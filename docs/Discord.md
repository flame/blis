## Introduction

This file walks the reader through basic instructions for joining the BLIS
community on [Discord](https://discord.com).

Discord is free to use for everyone. You can optionally pay for premium features via their "Nitro" subscription, but Nitro is not necessary for most casual users.

You may use Discord in any or all of the following ways:

- On mobile devices via the Android and iOS app stores
- Through a tab or window in a [web browser](https://discord.com/login))
- Via their standalone desktop application, available for download via their [Download](https://discord.com/download) page.

You can even stay logged in on multiple devices! Each one will automatically sync itself to newly sent/received messages.


## Joining Discord

If you don't already have a Discord account, you'll need to first create one.

As of this writing, you may follow these steps to create your account:

*NOTE: We recommend executing these steps using a desktop web browser (or standalone desktop app) rather than the mobile app. Once you've signed up and joined the BLIS server, you can proceed to use your client(s) of choice (mobile app, desktop app, or web browser).*

1. Go to [https://discord.com](https://discord.com) and click on "Login" at the top-right.
2. At the bottom of the dialog, click the "Register" link.
3. Enter the prompted information, such as username and email, then click "Continue".
4. Perform the Captcha verification.
5. This should take you into the web browser version of Discord. You will be asked if you want to create your own server. Close the dialog without making any selection.
6. At this point, you need to verify your email address. Check your email account for a message from Discord. Click the link in the email. This should bring up a dialog confirming your email has been verified. You may now close the web browser tab.

Congratulations! You're now a member of Discord and ready to join individual communities, or "servers."


## Obtaining the invite link

Ever since first creating the Discord server in 2021, we envisioned one day posting a permanent invite link in the official documentation (such as the GitHub-rendered [README.md](README.md) file.

However, due to a (perhaps irrational) concern for spammers, scammers, data-mining bots, and the like, we hesitated. Eventually, though, we decided to try it out.

While we do not have access to an official Captcha-like service to confirm that you are, indeed, a human interested in the BLIS community, we have our own creative way of obscuring the link from all but the most sophisticated software. (And honestly, if your bot figures out our invite link, it probably deserves a chance to join us since it might be sentient.)

Once you decipher the invite link, you shouldn't enter it into your web browser immediately. Please keep it handy for the appropriate step within the next section, [Joining the BLIS server](#joining-the-blis-server).

Here's an example link (for demonstration purposes only): `https://discord.gg/abC2jUVeip`

Notice that the link consists of `https://discord.gg/` followed by a 10-character string consisting of lower- and upper-case letters, and (typically) one number.

As an interested human, you'll need to reconstruct the 10-character string from the alphabet soup we provide below and then append it to the part of the link containing the Discord domain name. Notice that numbers are spelled out, and the case (lower or upper) is indicated accordingly.

Today's alphabet soup consists of **ee** **ZEE** **ex** **pee** **zee** **nine** **pee** **KAY** **ess** **ex**.

Note that the soup of the day may change from time to time.


## Joining the BLIS server

The BLIS community consists of a number of "channels" within a single Discord "server." The BLIS server, however, is not public and cannot be found via the Discord directory service. Therefore, you'll need a special invite link in order to join. (More on that in a bit.)

Once you have a Discord account, you will need an invite link. Once you've deciphered the link from the [previous section](#the-invite-link), follow these steps in order to join the BLIS server:

*NOTE: We recommend executing these steps using a desktop web browser (or standalone desktop app) rather than the mobile app. Once you've joined the BLIS server, you can proceed to use your client(s) of choice (mobile app, desktop app, or web browser).*

1. Log in to Discord.
2. Once logged in, on the left-hand side of the UI, click on the button with the "+" symbol. This will bring up a dialog asking if you want to create a server.
3. At the bottom of the dialog, there will be a section asking, "Have an invite already?" Click the button below it labeled "Join a Server".
4. Copy and paste the invite link into the prompt and click "Join Server".
5. This should bring up a dialog stating that you've been invited to join the BLIS server. Click on "Accept Invite". This will trigger a new dialog informing you that your account has been updated with the invitation.

That's it! Now that you've joined our server, please consider introducing yourself in `#general`! We love hearing about how application developers and end-users are using BLIS.

If you had any difficulty joining or with the invite link, please reach out to [field@cs.utexas.edu](field@cs.utexas.edu).


## Additional resources

Are you new to Discord? Not sure how to work this newfangled technology? Don't worry; once you learn the basics, you'll feel much more at home!

While a tutorial on Discord is beyond the scope of this document, there are countless articles and YouTube videos that introduce newcomers to Discord's UI. Here are a few articles on the basics:

Some things I recommend setting up shortly after you create your account:

- Take note of your username's "tag" or disambiguator. This is a four-digit number that gets appended to the end of your username (e.g. `bsmith#1234`), which helps when others need to identify you when there are multiple users with the same username.
- Not happy with your username? You can change it!
- Review your privacy settings, and consider using two-factor authentication.
- Personalize your account with a custom profile image.
- Consider switching to the "dark" theme (if you like dark modes on other sites or on mobile devices).
- Tweak other appearence settings such as the font size or UI compactness.
- Set up your notifications.

There are many other settings in Discord! Feel free to explore all of them by clicking the gear icon in the bottom-left area of your screen, just to the right of your username.

We hope you found this short guide useful, and we hope to see you on Discord! Thanks for your interest in BLIS and our community! :)
