### Low Precision POWER10 Kernels

This is a special BLIS Sandbox that allows users to call POWER10 reduced precision/integer `GEMM` kernels. 

Supported kernels: `IEEE float16 (bli_shgemm), bfloat16 (bli_sbgemm), int16 (bli_i16gemm), int8 (bli_i8gemm), int4 (bli_i4gemm)`.

#### Introduction

This document describes how the low precision POWER10 `gemm` kernels are implemented and explains how to call the POWER10 `GEMM` kernels. 

**Important: These kernels does not have the full functionality of BLIS. The kernels can only perform single threaded, no transpose, GEMM.**

#### Implementation

The kernels are implemented in `gemm.c`. They are instantiated with macro templates. The main template is called `GENERIC_GEMM`. This template is used to create the 5-loop `gemm` function.

#### Reduced precision/integer Types

| BLIS type  | BLIS char | Type definition                        | Used to represent...                 |
|:-----------|:----------|:---------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------|
| `float16`    | `h`    | `typedef union { uint16_t v; struct { uint16_t m:10; uint16_t e:5; uint16_t s:1} bits; }` | IEEE half-precision real numbers        |
| `bfloat16`   | `b`    | `typedef union { uint16_t v; struct { uint16_t m:7; uint16_t e:8; uint16_t s:1; } bits; }` | Google's half-precision real numbers    |
| `int16`    | `i16`     | `int16_t`    | 16 bit integers |
| `int8`     | `i8`       | `int8_t`  | 8 bit integers |
| `int4`     | `i4`       | `typedef union{ uint8_t v; struct { uint8_t nib1:4; uint8_t nib2:4; } bits; }` | 4 bit integers |

#### Reduced Precision/Integer API

The API that is used for the reduced precision/integer POWER10 `GEMM` kernels is similar to the existing [BLIS basic typed API](https://github.com/flame/blis/blob/master/docs/BLISTypedAPI.md). The main difference is the POWER10 kernels expect two types: `ctype_in` and `ctype_out`.

Thus the new `gemm` call looks like the following:

```
void bli_??gemm
     (
       trans_t transa,
       trans_t transb,
       dim_t   m,
       dim_t   n,
       dim_t   k,
       ctype_out*  alpha,
       ctype_in*   a, inc_t rsa, inc_t csa,
       ctype_in*   b, inc_t rsb, inc_t csb,
       ctype_out*  beta,
       ctype_out*  c, inc_t rsc, inc_t csc
     );
```

`??` is meant to replaced with the kernel prefix.

#### How To Build The Sandbox

Add the following flags when running the configure script to build BLIS correctly.

`CFLAGS="-fPIC -std=c99 -D_ISOC11_SOURCE -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200112L" -s power10`

Ensure that you have GCC 10.2 or greater.


#### P10 Testsuite

In `p10_testsuite`, there are performance gathering and correctness checking programs for the POWER10 reduced precision/integer `GEMM` kernels. By default, the performance gathering and correctness checking is done over square matrices ranging from 80 to 4000 in increments of 80. Performance is measured in GFLOPs, and correctness is measured using the BLIS method (detailed in `blis/testsuite/test_gemm.c`).
