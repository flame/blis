/*
    Functionality
    -------------

    This function copies a vector x to a vector y for
    type double.

    y := conj?(x)

    Function Signature
    -------------------

    * 'conjx' - Variable specified if x needs to be conjugated
    * 'n' - Length of the array passed
    * 'x' - Double pointer pointing to an array
    * 'y' - Double pointer pointing to an array
    * 'incx' - Stride to point to the next element in x array
    * 'incy' - Stride to point to the next element in y array
    * 'cntx' - BLIS context object

    Exception
    ----------

    None

    Deviation from BLAS
    --------------------

    None

    Undefined behaviour
    -------------------

    1. The kernel results in undefined behaviour when n < 0, incx < 1 and incy < 1.
       The expectation is that these are standard BLAS exceptions and should be handled in
       a higher layer
