   Assumptions:
   - B is row-stored;
   - A is row- or column-stored;
   - m0 and n0 are at most MR and NR, respectively.
   Therefore, this (r)ow-preferential kernel is well-suited for contiguous
   (v)ector loads on B and single-element broadcasts from A.

   NOTE: These kernels explicitly support column-oriented IO, implemented
   via an in-register transpose. And thus they also support the crr and
   ccr cases, though only crr is ever utilized (because ccr is handled by
   transposing the operation and executing rcr, which does not incur the
   cost of the in-register transpose).

// NOTE: Normally, for any "?x1" kernel, we would call the reference kernel.
// However, at least one other subconfiguration (zen) uses this kernel set, so
// we need to be able to call a set of "?x1" kernels that we know will actually
// exist regardless of which subconfiguration these kernels were used by. Thus,
// the compromise employed here is to inline the reference kernel so it gets
// compiled as part of the haswell kernel set, and hence can unconditionally be
// called by other kernels within that kernel set.
