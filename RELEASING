Here are the steps to follow to create a new release (version) of BLIS:

1. Make sure there are no commits that have yet to be pulled into
   local repository.

   $ git pull

   If there are any commits upstream, merge them as appropriate.

2. Verify that the code builds properly.

   $ ./configure auto; make

3. Verify that the code passes BLIS and BLAS tests:

   $ make check           # BLIS testsuite (fast) + BLAS test drivers
   $ make checkblis       # BLIS testsuite (full ex. mixed-datatype)
   $ make checkblis-md    # BLIS testsuite (mixed-datatype only)
   $ make checkblis-salt  # BLIS testsuite (fast + salt)

4. Draft a new announcement to blis-devel, crediting those who
   contributed towards this version by browsing 'git log'.

5. Update CREDITS file if 'git log' reveals any new contributors.

6. Update docs/ReleaseNotes.md file with body of finalized announcement
   and the date of the release.

7. Commit changes from steps 5 and 6.

8. Bump the version number:

   $ ./build/bump-version.sh "0.3.2"

   This will result in two new commits: a version file update and a CHANGELOG
   file update.

9. Push the new commits and new tag associated with the new version:

   $ git push
   $ git push --tag

10. Send finalized announcement to blis-devel.
