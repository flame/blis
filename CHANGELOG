    Migrated 'bl2' prefix to 'bli'.
    
    Details:
    - Changed all filename and function prefixes from 'bl2' to 'bli'.
    - Changed the "blis2.h" header filename to "blis.h" and changed all
      corresponding #include statements accordingly.
    - Fixed incorrect association for Fran in CREDITS file.

    Removed several 'old' directories and files.
    
    Details:
    - Removed most of the 'old' directories scattered throughout the framework,
      which includes alternate/half-baked/broken implementations.

    Removed #include "blis2.h" from low-level headers.
    
    Details:
    - Removed #include of "blis2.h" from various lower-level, operation-specific
      header files throughout the framework. Given that these low-level headers
      are included within #blis2.h in a very specific order, #include'ing blis2.h
      within them directly is unnecessary.

    Added cpp guards to conflicting libflame typedefs.
    
    Details:
    - Added cpp guards around the definitions of dim_t, scomplex, and dcomplex.
      This is a temporary hack to allow interoperability with libflame. (Similarly
      temporary changes are being made to libflame's type definitions file.)

    Renamed MAX_PREFETCH_BYTE_OFFSET to MAX_PRELOAD_.
    
    Details:
    - Renamed BLIS_MAX_PREFETCH_BYTE_OFFSET to
      BLIS_MAX_PRELOAD_BYTE_OFFSET since "prefetch" is kind of a loaded word
      (e.g. "prefetch" instructions, which are different than the particular
      kind of prefetching/preloading referred to by this constant).

    Relocated packed mem_t dimension fields to obj_t.
    
    Details:
    - Removed the m and n (and elem_size) fields from the mem_t object, and added
      m_packed and n_packed fields to obj_t. These new fields track the same as
      the old ones. From an abstraction standpoint, it seemed awkward to store
      those dimensions inside the mem_t.
    - Updated interfaces to bl2_mem_acquire_*() so that only a byte size argument
      is passed in, instead of m, n, and elem_size.
    - Updated bl2_packm_init_pack() and bl2_packv_init_pack() to inline the
      functionality of bl2_mem_alloc_update_m() and bl2_mem_alloc_update_v(),
      respectively.
    - Updated packm variants to access the packed length and width fields from
      their new locations.

commit e7d41229d3b1674e74f47d7f29fae004a745201a (tag: 0.0.4)
Author: Field G. Van Zee <field@cs.utexas.edu>
Date:   Fri Mar 15 17:12:36 2013 -0500

    Re-implemented contiguous memory allocator.
    
    Details:
    - Completely re-wrote the contiguous memory allocator (bl2_mem.c). The new
      allocator instantiates and initializes three separate memory pool objects,
      each one associated with a separate array of contiguous memory blocks, each
      block of fixed and uniform size. (The three pools are for allocating mc-by-kc
      blocks of A, kc-by-nc panels of B, and mc-by-nc panels of C.) The pool
      objects use a stack structure internally to track which blocks in the region
      have been "checked out" to a thread and which are still available. Critical
      regions are now clearly marked and adaptable to parallel environments (e.g.
      OpenMP). Memory pools are set up when bl2_init() is called.
    - Added a new field to the packm control tree node, which indicates what kind
      of packed buffer is being allocated. The enumerated type for this argument
      is defined as packbuf_t in bl2_type_defs.h.
    - Updated level-3 _cntl.c files to pass in the appropriate value for a new
      packbuf_t argument to bl2_packm_cntl_obj_create().
    - Moved some macros called by packm_init_pack() from bl2_obj_macro_defs.h to
      bl2_mem_macro_defs.h.
    - Added BLIS_MAX_NUM_THREADS to bl2_config.h, which we use as the default
      number of blocks of A reserved for the memory allocator.
    - Deprecated bl2_align_dim(). Replaced usage with that of
      bl2_align_dim_to_mult(). Turns out that typically we don't need to align
      a dimension to the system alignment, since that value has to do with
      starting addresses, whereas the values we are dealing with are unitless
      dimensions.

    Perform her2k var1 loops in sequence.
    
    Details:
    - Changed variant 1 of her2k so that the two rank-k products are computed
      and accumulated in sequence rather than fused into one loop. This is
      necessary if BLIS is to be configured to provide only enough contiguous
      memory for one panel of B.

    Enhanced tracking of dimensions for mem_t objects.
    
    Details:
    - Added new fields to mem_t struct definition to track the allocated (as
      opposed to the currently used) dimensions of the memory region. This
      allows packm_init() to be more robust in situations where memory is
      already allocated but is more than needed for the current packing job.
    - Updated logic in bl2_obj_set_buffer_with_cached_packm_mem() macro, used
      in packm_init(), to update the "currently used" dimensions of the mem_t
      object if the requested dimensions are smaller than the allocated
      dimensions.

    Added "version" to .gitignore.
    
    Details:
    - Added "version" to .gitignore file so that the file does not show up when
      running 'git status', or accidentally get pulled into the index when
      running 'git add' or 'git add --all'.

    Removed version file from version control.
    
    Details:
    - Removed version file from version control to prevent git errors that occur
      when trying to pull new commits.

    Updated behavior of bl2_obj_induce_trans() macro.
    
    Details:
    - Changed bl2_obj_induce_trans() so that the transposition bit is no longer
      updated as part of the macro. All current uses of the macro have been
      coupled with instances of bl2_obj_set_trans() to clear the bit.
    - Added Jed to CREDITS file.

    Replaced banded/packed BLAS2 stubs with f2c code.
    
    Details:
    - Retired the blas2blis wrappers that simply called abort with a "not yet
      implemented" message. This includes all of the level-2 banded and packed
      routines.
    - Replaced the aforementioned with the corresponding netlib implementations
      having been run through f2c (with some customization).
    - Added directories named 'attic' to build/gen-make-frags/ignore_list.

    Details:
    - Moved the Fortran-77 name-mangling macros from bl2_blas_macro_defs.h to the
      configuration directory (bl2_config.h, specifically) given that it can be
      expected to be tweaked by some developers.

Date:   Fri Feb 22 12:11:24 2013 -0600

    Implemented blas2blis compatibility layer.
    
    Details:
    - Added the blas2blis compatibility layer, located in frame/compat. This
      includes virtually all of the BLAS, including banded and packed level-2
      operations.
    
    - Defined bl2_init_safe(), bl2_finalize_safe(). The former allows a conditional
      initialization, which stores the "exit status" in an err_t, which is then
      read by the latter function to determine whether finalization should actually
      take place.
    - Added calls to bl2_init_safe(), bl2_finalize_safe() to all level-2 and
      level-3 BLAS-like wrappers.
    - Added configuration option to instruct BLIS to remain initialized whenever
      it automatically initializes itself (via bl2_init_safe()), until/unless the
      application code explicitly calls bl2_finalize().
    
    - Added INSERT_GENTFUNC* and INSERT_GENTPROT* macros to facilitate type
      templatization of blas2blis wrappers.
    - Defined level-0 scalar macro bl2_??swaps().
    - Defined level-1v operation bl2_swapv().
    - Defined some "Fortran" types to bl2_type_defs.h for use with BLAS
      wrappers.

    Fixed some scalar types in BLAS-like Herm APIs.
    
    Details:
    - Some of the scalars of Hermitian operations, such as alpha in her,
      alpha and beta in herk, and beta in her2k, need to be real. These
      arguments were typed incorrectly as the complex types. This has been
      fixed. Note the issue was only present in the BLAS-like APIs for
      these operations (not the native object-based interfaces).

    Changed API of packm_init_pack() to use blksz_t.
    
    Details:
    - Changed the interface of packm_init_pack() so that mult_m and mult_n
      are passed in as type blksz_t* instead of dim_t.
    - Make similar change for packv_init_pack().

    Minor changes to lower levels of scalm and setm.
    
    Details:
    - Removed diagx parameter from lower-level interfaces of scalm.
    - Modified scalm_basic_check() to expect an object with a nonunit diagonal.
    - Changed setm_unb_var1() so that having an implicit unit diagonal results
      in only the strictly lower or upper triangle of the matrix being modified.

    Removed some calls to setv() in test modules.
    
    Details:
    - Removed calls to setv() in test modules whose sole purpose was to
      initialize vectors to zero to ensure that nan's and inf's would not
      taint the computation. Now that beta == zero semantics have been
      updated to clear the output operand (when beta is zero), rather than
      multiply against it, these setv() calls are no longer needed.

    Properly implemented beta == 0 semantics.
    
    Details:
    - Changed name of set0 and set0_mxn macros to set0s and set0s_mxn,
      respectively.
    - Added code to the following operations that sets the output operand to
      zero if the corresponding scalar is zero (rather than performing the
      floating-point multiply, or in the case of setv, copying the value).
      This will prevent nan's and inf's from creeping into results from
      uninitialized memory.

    Fixed stale interface to packm_unb_var1().
    
    Details:
    - Removed the control tree from the interface to packm_unb_var1(), which
      I meant to do when it was un-deprecated.

    Un-deprecated packm_unb_var1.c (needed by l2 ops).
    
    Details:
    - Added bl2_packm_unb_var1() back into the mix once I realized that level-2
      operations still need this routine for packing matrices. Now, whether
      level-2 operations should be packing matrices to begin with is another
      matter. But this fixes the segmentation fault one would have gotten when
      running bl2_gemv() on a general stride matrix.

    Removed cntl tree usage from packm implementation.
    
    Details:
    - Added new fields to obj_t info field:
      - invert_diag
      - pack_order_if_upper
      - pack_order_if_lower
      These fields allow packm_init() to embed information that begins
      in the control tree into the object so that the packm implementation
      does not need to use control trees at all. This is being done to aid
      Bryan's DxT code generation.
    - Added macros that operate on above fields.
    - Changed packm_init(), packm_blk_var2(), and packm_blk_var3() according
      to above changes.
    - Made similar (but much simpler) changes to packv.
    - Deprecated packm_blk_var1(), packm_unb_var1(), and packm_densify().
      These were part of prototype implementations and are no longer needed.

Date:   Mon Feb 11 13:20:44 2013 -0600

    Added unified test suite, and many fixes.
    
    Details:
    - Added a highly configurable, unified test suite.
    
    - Removed DUPB configuration constant from bl2_kernel.h and macro-kernel
      header files. Now, instead, DUPB is computed as (NDUP != 1) within each
      macro-kernel. This fixes a bug in trmm/trsm whereby bp was indexed into
      incorrectly when DUPB was set to FALSE but the NDUP was still non-unit.
      By encoding both pieces of information into one constant in _kernel.h,
      it seems somewhat less likely others will encounter this bug in the
      future.
    - Added level-2 cache blocksizes to _kernel.h for reference configuration,
      and defined blocksizes in _cntl.c files to these default values.
    
    - Changed semantics of her2k and syr2k such that these operations no longer
      expect the B matrix to already be conjugate-transposed (or just transposed
      for syr2k). However, these semantics are preserved for the internal
      mechanics of the implementations, including the internal back-end and all
      blocked variants.
    - Inserted checks for real-valued alpha and beta for herk/her2k and herk,
      respectively.
    
    - Relaxed general object structure constraints in _basic_check() for gemv, ger.
    - Changed her front-end to NOT copy-cast to real projection; instead, this is
      replaced by selecting either the real part or both parts within the unblocked
      algorithm implementation, depending on the value of conjh.
    - Added conjh to all _check routines for her so that the code knows when to
      verify that alpha has an imaginary component equal to zero (for her, but
      not syr).
    - Changed control tree for her to forgo packing.
    
    - Added unit diagonal support to fnormm.
    - Redefined real versions of abval2s macros in terms of fabs(), fabsf().
    - Redefined complex versions of sqrt2s macros using the actual "complex square
      root" formula.
    - Created new level-0 object-based routines, suffixed with "sc" (for "scalar").
    - Defined new level-1v, -1d, and -1m versions of add and sub operations
      (two-operand add and subtract).
    - Added new scalar macros:
      - getris: acquire real and imaginary components.
      - setris: set real and imaginary components.
      - addjs: addition with conjugated x.
      - subjs: subtraction with conjugated x.
    - Defined new utility operations:
      - absumv: element-wise sum of absolute values for vector elements.
      - absumm: element-wise sum of absolute values for matrix elements.
      - mkherm: convert existing matrix to Hermitian.
      - mksymm: convert existing matrix to symmetric.
      - mktrim: convert existing matrix to triangular.
    
    - Added various error checking routines.
    - Added bl2_clock_min_diff(), which is used to more cleanly measure the
      wall clock time of a code block.
    - Added general stride support to bl2_obj_alloc_buffer().
    - Added bl2_obj_init_scalar().
    - Updated parameter mapping in bl2_param_map.c.
    - Added support for queriable version string.
    
    - Fixed a bug in the her2k macro-kernels (which currently are simply
      implemented in terms of two invocations of herk) whereby beta was being
      applied to both the first and second rank-k updates, rather than only
      the first.
    - Fixed a bug in trmm/trsm whereby transpose and right side cases were not
      properly implemented due to erroneous assumptions regarding aliasing and
      root objects.
    - Fixed a bug in the upper triangular trsm macro-kernel in which the wrong
      MR x NR block of B was being updated.
    - Fixed a bug in the inverts macro in the double real case whereby the
      value was typecast to float before inversion. This affected non-unit cases
      of dtrsm.
    - Fixed a bug in the reference kernels for gemmtrsm whereby the minus one
      constant was being applied incorrectly.
    - Fixed a bug in the overall treatment of non-unit alpha for trsm. The code
      now mimics the rank-k strategy of gemm, whereby alpah is applied during
      the first iteration of variant 3, with BLIS_ONE passed in instead for
      subsequent iterations. This also required passing alpha into the macro-
      kernels as well as the fused gemmtrsm micro-kernels.
    - Fixed a bug in trsm_u_blk_var1 whereby the gemm macro-kernel was being
      called for blocks strictly above the diagonal. While this sounds good in
      theory, this cannot be done because gemm_ker_var2 expects row panels of
      A to be packed from top to bottom, while for trsm_u, A is actually packed
      from bottom to top due to the reverse (BR->TL) nature of the algorithm.
    - Fixed a bug in packm_cxk() whereby panel packings with unit panel
      dimensions were mishandled due to incorrect arguments to the copyv kernel.
      Also changed the copyv kernel invocation to scal2v so that these edge
      cases are properly handled when scaling is requested.
    - Fixed a bug in packv_int() whereby an uninitialized object is passed in
      instead of the source object.
    - Fixed a bug whereby level-2 code could allocate memory dynamically via
      bl2_malloc() and then attempt to free it via bl2_mm_release(). Also fixed
      a potential future bug whereby a mem_t object that is actually no longer
      "allocated" from the static pool is mistaken for being allocated due to
      failure to NULLify the buffer when the block was most recently released.
    - Fixed a bug in bl2_acquire_mpart_*() whreby the uplo field was mistakenly
      toggled when the requested subpartition needed to be "reflected" due to it
      residing in an unstored region.

Date:   Fri Jan 4 10:37:27 2013 -0600

    Added debug statements to bl2_mm_acquire_m().
    
    Details:
    - Added printf() statements to bl2_mm_acquire_m() to help debug issues
      with prematurely exhausted memory pool.
    - Removed 'd' from kernel names of reference kernels in clarksville
      configuration's bl2_kernel.h

    Defined Frobenius norm operations.
    
    Details:
    - Added level-0 grabis macro operation to grab imaginary component of one
      variable and copy it to the real component of another variable.
    - Defined sumsqv operation, which computes the sum of the absolute squares
      of the elements of a vector. This implementation is modeled after ?lassq
      in netlib LAPACK.
    - Defined fnormv and fnormm operations, which compute the Frobenius norm on
      vectors and matrices, respectively. These operations are treated as one-
      operand operations where the output norm value is the real projection of
      the datatype of the input operand. Both operations are implemented in terms
      of sumsqv.

    Added GENT*R macros; tweaked bl2_machval defs.
    
    Details:
    - Added function and prototype macro-generating macros for GENTFUNCR and
      GENTPROTR, which are one-operand macros with auxiliary real projection
      types.
    - Tweaked bl2_machval files to use new macros.

    Fixed harmless macro bug in level-1m operations.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed some inconsistent usage of n_iter_max and n_iter in the two
      bl2_set_dims_incs_uplo_[12]m macros. The right thing ended up happening
      despite the bug, which is why I had not discovered it until now.

Date:   Tue Dec 18 15:07:36 2012 -0600

    Renamed x86,x86_64 kernels to indicate 'd' fusing.
    
    Details:
    - Renamed x86 and x86_64 kernels to contain a 'd' before the fusing shape
      to emphasize that the fusing shape is not for all datatype instances, but
      rather just for one (that of double-precision real). Other fusing shapes
      would be proportional to their precision and domain "byte footprints".
    - Corresponding changes to config/clarksville/bl2_kernel.h.

    More tweaks to _config.h, _kernel.h; smem tweaks.
    
    Details:
    - Moved kernel-related definitions form bl2_config.h to bl2_kernel.h.
    - Replaced #define of _GNU_SOURCE with #define of _POSIX_C_SOURCE. This
      accomplishes the same thing (enabling posix_memalign()) without enabling
      all of the GNU extensions we don't need.
    - Defined the size of the static memory pool in terms of MC, KC, and NC,
      as well as two new constants that determine how many MCxKC blocks and
      how many KCxNC blocks should be allocated (defined in bl2_config.h).
    - In the case of static memory pool exhaustion, replaced the generic
      bl2_abort() with a specific error code call.

    Fixed bug in reference gemm ukernels.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug whereby, for the reference gemm ukernels, the matrix product
      was not correctly accumulated and scaled (by alpha) into the output matrix
      C. (Thanks to Fran for finding this bug.)
    - Whitespace changes to reference trsm kernels.

    Expanded reference packm/unpackm kernel set to 16.
    
    Details:
    - Added 10xk, 12xk, 14xk, and 16xk reference kernels for packm and
      unpackm.
    - Updated bl2_[un]packm_cxk() to silently use scal2m if "out of range"
      kernel size is requested. (Thanks to Tyler for finding this bug.)
    - Updated bl2_kernel.h to contain new _KERNEL definitions, according
      to above changes, for 'reference' and 'clarksville' configurations.
    - Updated CHANGELOG.
    - Removed "output*.m" from .gitignore.

Author: Field G. Van Zee <field@cs.utexas.edu>
Date:   Thu Dec 6 15:34:53 2012 -0600

    Added auto-detection of version string (via git).
    
    Details:
    - Added build/update-version-file.sh script for auto-detecting "version"
      string and updating 'version' file accordingly. (If .git directory is
      not present, then it is assumed this copy of BLIS is a downloaded
      release, in which case 'version' file is left unchanged.)
    - Added invocation of update-version-file.sh to configure script.
