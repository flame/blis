    Added a script to help create new rc branches.
    
    Details:
    - Added a new script, build/start-new-rc.sh, which:
      1. Updates the version file with a new version string.
      2. Commits (locally) the version string update.
      3. Updates the CHANGELOG file with the output of 'git log'.
      4. Commits (locally) the CHANGLOG file update.
      5. Creates a new branch whose name is equal to "<vers>-rc0" where
         <vers> is the new version string.
      6. Reminds the user to execute some final steps if everything looks
         good.
      This new script will help in the future when it's time to start a new
      release candidate branch/lineage off of 'master'. Note that this
      script is based on build/bump-version.sh (which itself may change in
      the future due to changes in the way versions/releases will be handled
      going forward).

    Use "-i auto" by default in test/3 drivers.
    
    Details:
    - Request default induced method behavior of BLIS via "-i auto" when
      running the standalone performance drivers in test/3 via the runme.sh
      script present in that directory. (Previously, the runme.sh script
      would use "-i native" by default.) This change was originally intended
      for fd1a7e3.

    Allow test/3 drivers to use default ind_t method. (#804)
    
    Details:
    - Previously, the standalone performance drivers in test/3 were written
      under the assumption that the user would want to explicitly test
      either native execution *or* 1m. But because the accompanying runme.sh
      script defaults to passing "native" in for the -i command line option
      (which explicitly sets the induced method type), running the script
      without modification causes the test drivers to use slow reference
      microkernels on systems where native complex-domain microkernels are
      not registered -- which will yield poor performance for complex-domain
      level-3 operations. Furthermore, even if a user was aware of this, the
      test drivers did not support any single value for the -i option that
      would test BLIS using the library's default behavior -- that is, using
      1m on systems where it is needed and native execution on systems that
      have native microkernels implemented and registered.
    - This commit addresses the aforementioned issue by supporting a new
      value for the -i option: "auto". The "auto" value causes the driver
      to avoid explicitly setting the induced method altogether, leaving
      BLIS's default behavior in place. This "auto" option is also now the
      default setting within the runme.sh script. Thanks to Leick Robinson
      for finding and reporting this issue.
    - Also added support for "nat" as a shorthand for "native", which
      the help text already (erroneously) claimed was supported.

    Refactor the control tree and other infrastructure (#710)
    
    Details:
    1. A "plugin" architecture.
    - Users are now able to register new kernels, kernel preferences, and
      blocksizes at runtime, directly from user applications.
    - Plugins can be created, configured, and built using only an installed
      version of BLIS -- no source or source code changes required.
    - Plugins support both reference and optimized kernels, as well as
      custom configuration-to-kernel-set mappings.
    - Building plugins (including reference and relevant optimized kernels)
      for enabled architectures or architecture families is automated, as is
      linking into the final library.
    - The configure script is now installed as 'configure-plugin'. In this
      mode, it can be used to initialize a plugin from a template including
      optional example code, and prepare a build system for compiling the
      plugin into a shared or static library.
    - Additional configuration files, templates, and build system components
      are also installed to '%prefix%/share/blis'.
    - The cntx_t struct now has extensible data structures for holding
      kernels, preferences, and blocksizes. These are based on a "stack"
      structure which contains a list of fixed-size data blocks. Adding a
      new entry (which may require allocating a new block or reallocating
      the block pointer array) requires locking, but looking up entries is
      lock-free and takes O(1) time.
    - Kernels can depend on either 1 or 2 type parameters (e.g.
      mixed-precision packing requires 2). The func2_t struct supports
      the latter, but can be implicitly cast to func_t if only "diagonal"
      entries are needed. The number of type parameters can be inferred from
      the kernel ID for type safety.
    - Functions have been added to register new kernels, preferences, and
      blocksizes with the global kernel structure (gks). This creates
      corresponding entries in each allocated context and returns the next
      available ID. Plugins use this API to register user kernels, although
      the user is responsible for tracking the returned IDs for later
      lookup. Setting newly-registered reference kernels, as well as
      overriding these with optimized kernels is done in exactly the same
      manner as in bli_cntx_init_ref() and bli_cntx_init_<subconfig>().
    
    2. Restructuring of the control and thread control trees.
    - The control tree has been substantially restructured to support more
      flexibility.
    - The "default" control trees for gemm (also used for
      hemm/symm/herk/her2k/syrk/syr2k/trmm/trmm3) and trsm are now
      represented as a single structure containing all necessary control
      tree nodes and parameters.
    - An API has been added to modify the default gemm/trsm control trees.
    - This same API is used by the framework and packm/gemm/trsm variants
      to access specific control tree nodes.
    - Users can alternatively create a custom control tree from scratch.
    - The blocksizes are now encoded directly in the control tree, rather
      than via loop IDs. The logic for adjusting blocksizes for certain
      operations has been moved to the control tree initialization.
    - Type information is encoded in the control tree to drive proper
      selection of packing and computational kernels provided by the user.
    - The packing microkernel now receives an opaque "params" struct which
      is user-definable and can be used to pass additional information
      through the call stack.
    - The auxinfo_t struct has been updated with a .params field for
      opaque user data as well as the global offsets of the current
      microtile.
    - The packm and gemm variants can be overridden by the user, and also
      receive an opaque params struct via the associated control tree
      node.
    - The structure-aware packing kernel bli_packm_struc_cxk() is no longer
      hard-coded to be called from the default packm variant, but can be
      overridden by the user. It also supports mixed-precision/mixed-domain
      natively now.
    - The thread control tree (thrinfo_t) is now created entirely up-front
      by inspecting the control tree. The required number of threads at each
      level is encoded in the control tree via loop IDs (actually a bitfield
      of loop IDs), although the ordering and number of such IDs is
      arbitrary. The logic for adjusting the number of threads at each level
      based on operation type (e.g. trmm) is now in the control tree
      initialization and expressed by combining loop IDs from multiple
      levels into a single level.
    - The mem_t object containing the pack buffer pointer has been moved
      from the control tree to the thread control tree. NOTE: **The control
      tree is now strictly const throughout the operation, and only a
      single copy is shared by all threads.**
    - The thread control tree node for packing has been changed so that
      there is no longer a "fake" node indicating a team of single threads.
      Instead, the number of threads and thread IDs in the "normal" thread
      control tree node are used. This change has also been made to the
      gemmsup thread control tree and packing variants, as well as to the
      gemmlike sandbox.
    - Parameters controlling packing (e.g. inversion of the diagonal,
      direction, schema) are not stored directly in the control tree but in
      the opaque params struct. The packing control tree node and its
      default params struct are stored together in the "combined"
      gemm/trsm control tree structure and initialized as a unit. Users can
      update these parameters individually or substitute a custom packm
      variant and params struct.
    - The "target" and "execution" datatypes has been removed from the obj_t
      struct and replaced by type information in the control tree.
    - The "sub-node" and "sub-prenode" of a control tree node have been
      replaced by an arbitrary number of sub-nodes accessed by index. There
      is a hard cap on the number of sub-nodes (currently 2). Sub-nodes are
      added during control tree initialization, *after*
      creation/initialization of the parent node through an updated API.
    - The level-3 thread decorator has been significantly simplified and
      directly calls bli_l3_int(). The control tree is created externally,
      and it is no longer necessary to alias matrices or set object pack
      schemas. Also, the rntm_t passed in may be NULL. Finally, family
      and scalar information is no longer needed here.
    - bli_l3_int() is now a simple inline function which extracts the next
      control tree node and variant and calls it.
    - bli_*_front() have been removed and inlined into the expert object
      API with significant simplification.
    - 1m (or other induced method) no longer uses an alternative cntx_t.
    - The .pack_fn/.ker_fn pointers and associated params fields on the
      obj_t were removed in favor of the present solution.
    
    3. Overhaul of variable substitution in configure script.
    - The configure script has been somewhat re-written to use a
      centralized mechanism for substituting variables into build system and
      other configuration files.
    - All substitution variables go through the same pathway now, which
      necessitated some variable naming changes for variables which were
      named the same in e.g. Makefile and bli_config.h but with
      different definitions.
    - CC and CXX variables can now contain spaces, e.g. 'g++ -std=c++17'.
      This provides better support for integration with build tooling such
      as autotools.
    
    4. Overhaul of packing kernels.
    - Previously there were two packing kernels referenced in the cntx_t
      structure for MRxk and NRxk shaped micropanels, respectively. These
      have now been merged into one kernel which is responsible for packing
      any dense rectangular portion of either A or B.
    - The packing kernel now receives information about the register
      blocksize (cdim_max) and duplication factor (the "broadcast-B"
      format, although this can also apply to the A matrix).
    - The structure-aware packing kernel (bli_packm_struc_cxk(), which is
      now user-overridable) also receives global offsets of the current
      micropanel within A or B.
    - Explicit kernels for packing the diagonal blocks of
      triangular/symmetric/Hermitian matrices have been added to the
      cntx_t. This means that the bli_packm_struc_ckx() "kernel" no longer
      needs to directly touch data (except to zero out some regions).
    - bli_packm_struc_cxk() has also been updated to work only in terms of
      fundamental elements (i.e., real datatypes) when computing offsets and
      when zeroing data, which greatly simplifies mixed-domain/1m packing.
    - bli_packm_scalar() has been updated to better support complex scalars
      in mixed-domain operations.
    - Pack schemas for PACKED_ROW_PANELS* and PACKED_COL_PANELS* have
      been merged into simply PACKED_PANELS*. This reflects the merging of
      the packing kernels into a single generic kernel. There were only a
      very few places which needed the row/column information and this is
      now supplied by alternative means.
    - Packing variants always behave "as if" the A matrix were being packed
      (i.e. the code assumes packing column-stored row panels). Packing of B
      is handled by applying an implicit or explicit transpose before
      packing. This change also applies to gemmsup.
    
    5. Improved MD/MP support.
    - All level-3 operations (except trsm) now support full
      mixed-domain/mixed-precision operation.
    - Explicit 1m packing kernels have been added in the cntx_t.
    - An explicit 1m microkernel wrapper has been added to the cntx_t.
    - An extra packing kernel for the "ro" format has been added, along with
      the pack_t enumeration value. This supports the packing for
      real*complex -> real, including potential scaling by a complex alpha,
      support for structured matrices, etc.
    - Extra microkernel wrappers for mixed-domain operations have been added
      to support the 'ccr' (and by extension, 'crc'), 'rcc', and 'crr'
      cases. Notably this includes full support for general stride storage
      and complex alpha/beta.
    - Packing kernels and gemm microkernels are now "templated" based on two
      type parameters rather than one. For packing this allows direct
      optimization of mixed-precision kernels, and for gemm microkernels
      this allows direct optimization of mixed-precision without writing to
      a temporary buffer. Reference packing kernels are directly
      instantiated for all mixes of precisions, while by default
      mixed-precision gemm microkernels are supported via a microkernel
      wrapper. The "old" way of specifying optimized kernels using a single
      type parameter works unchanged.
    - alpha and beta are typecast appropriately to the computational or
      output datatype, respectively, and **always** to the complex domain.
      Scalar typecasting has also been added to gemmsup for safety.
    - The gemm macrokernel doesn't have to do any typecasting anymore, as a
      microkernel wrapper or optimized mixed-precision/mixed-domain kernel
      now handles this.
    - 1m and mixed-domain operations now always use a microkernel wrapper,
      rather than adjusting parameters in the gemm macrokernel.
    - The gemmt macrokernel **does** still have to handle explicit
      write-back of microtiles which intersect the diagonal, although
      typecasting has already been performed.
    - The gemmt_x_ker_var2(), trmm_xx_ker_var2(), and trsm_xx_ker_var2()
      functions have been removed. The appropriate macrokernel pointer is
      selected during control tree initialization.
    - Real domain MR/NR are checked for even-ness based on the gemm
      microkernel's row preference in order to guarantee proper 1m and
      mixed-domain operation.
    - Full range of mixed-domain/mixed-precision functionality tested in the
      testsuite ('input.*.mixed').
    
    6. Other changes:
    - The build system has been updated to support C++ source files
      throughout the framework. While the intent is not to add such files to
      BLIS itself, this supports plugins written in C++.
    - Many instances of configuration-specific code have been simplified by
      introducing an INSERT_GENTCONF macro which instantiates a block of
      code for each enabled sub-configuration. The ConfigurationHowTo.md
      document has been updated accordingly.
    - PASTEMAC?/PASTECH?/PASTEF77? have been removed in favor of
      variadic macros which accept any number of arguments (up to a
      reasonable limit).
    - The INSERT_GENTFUNC* macros have been updated to clean up
      mixed-precision and mixed-domain instantiations.
    - bli_align_dim_to_mult() has been updated to support rounding either up
      or down based on a flag.
    - Checking for empty matrices and other early exits (level-3 only) has
      been consolidated into a single utility function.
    - The auxinfo_t struct is always passed as const.
    - The new function bli_obj_alias_submatrix() aliases a matrix while also
      resetting the root to NULL, offsets to zero (while adjusting the
      buffer), and applying any implicit transpose.
    - Level-3 pruning functions now only check matrix structure to see what
      to do, not the operation family.
    - gemmsup packing has been updated to use the "normal" pack buffer
      allocation routines.
    - Remove duplicate checks for early return from gemmsup handler.
    - bli_determine_blocksize() has been significantly simplified.
    - Partitioning packed panels is no longer allowed.
    - Added bli_xxsame macros.
    - Automated the calculation of info bit shifts and masks based on
      predefined bit sizes for various flags. This greatly simplifies
      reordering, adding, or removing flags from the info/info2 bitfields.
    - Moved more BLIS_NUM_* macros into the corresponding enums as the
      last entry so that the value is automatically computed.
    - Better const-correctness in some level0 scalar macros.
    - Better mixed-precision support in some level0 scalar macros.
    - Added a bli_axpbys_mxn() macro.
    - bli_thread_range_sub() takes explicit thread ID and number of threads
      rather than a thrinfo_t node.
    - "De-templated" BLIS gemmlike sandbox (specifically, bls_gemm_bp_var1()
      and bls_packm_var1()).
    - Combined bls_l3_packm_[ab]() into one function with thin wrappers.
    - Deleted bls_packm_var[23]().
    - Add a "termination tag" to the testsuite output so that
      'make check-blis' can accurately check for successful completion.
    - Add a new function to centrally compute FLOPs for level-3 operations
      in the testsuite.

    Update BLIS_*_INITIALIZER macros for C++ compatibility. (#802)
    
    Details:
    - Remove designated initializer syntax. This isn't officially supported
      until C++20.
    - Arrange initializers in the order in which they are defined in the
      struct. Even with standard or extension support for designated
      initializers, initializing non-static members out-of-order is an
      error in C++.
    - Remove the conditional code which uses '-1' as the default value of
      the 'pack_buf' member of 'mem_t' in C, but 'BLIS_BUFFER_FOR_GEN_USE'
      in C++. Simply use the latter as a common-sense default.

    Include bli_config.h before bli_system.h in cblas.h. (#789)
    
    Details:
    - Previously, in cblas.h, bli_config.h was being #included *after*
      bli_system.h, which meant that the BLIS_ENABLE_SYSTEM macro was
      never defined in time for proper OS detection. This bug only
      affected cblas.h -- blis.h had been correctly #including
      bli_config.h before bli_system.h since fb93d24. Thanks to
      Edward Smyth for reporting this bug and suggesting the fix.

    Fixed random segfault in test/3 drivers. (#788)
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a segfault in the non-gemm test drivers in test/3 that was the
      result of sometimes leaving either .n_str or .k_str fields of the
      params_t struct uninitialized, depending on the operation in question.
      For example, in test_hemm.c, init_def_params() would only initialize
      the .m_str and .n_str fields, but not the .k_str field. Even though
      hemm doesn't use a 'k' dimension, the proc_params() function (called
      via parse_cl_params()) universally attempts to convert all three into
      integers via sscanf(), which was understandably failing when one of
      those strings was a NULL pointer. I'm not sure how this code ever
      worked to begin with. Special thanks to Leick Robinson for finding and
      reporting this bug.

    Install helper headers to INCDIR prefix. (#787)
    
    Details:
    - Install one-line headers to INCDIR whose entire purpose is to
      #include the actual headers within the local 'blis' header directory
      so that applications can #include "blis.h" instead of #include
      <blis/blis.h> (and/or "cblas.h" instead of <blis/cblas.h> if CBLAS is
      enabled) when headers are installed to global paths. (Note that
      INCDIR is the installation prefix for headers as specified by
      '--includedir=INCDIR', which defaults to 'PREFIX/include' if not
      specified.) Not sure how this problem went unreported for so long,
      since presumably any user trying to #include "blis.h" from a global
      installation would have encountered a compiler error.
    - The one-line blis.h and cblas.h headers now reside in the 'build'
      directory, ready to install as is.
    - Thanks to to Jed Brown for reporting this via Issue #786, and for
      Devin Matthews and Mo Zhou for their engagement.
    - Harmonized the rule in the top-level Makefile for installing blis.pc
      into SHAREDIR/pkgconfig with conventions for others vis-a-vis
      verbosity/non-verbosity.

    Allow users to defines [sd]complex using std::complex (#784)
    
    Details:
    - In C++ applications, it makes a lot of sense to interface to BLIS
      using C++'s standard complex number library, which uses a template
      class std::complex. Obviously BLIS doesn't know anything about this
      and defaults to a custom struct to represent complex numbers. This PR
      updates the bli_[cz]{real,imag}() functions to accept std::complex
      numbers when a C++ compiler is being used. Note that this has no
      effect on the compilation of the BLIS library (or testsuite), and only
      comes into play when including blis.h into a C++ project and forcing
      the use of std::complex for scomplex and dcomplex.
    - The application can explicitly request std:complex-based types via:
    
        #define BLIS_ENABLE_STD_COMPLEX
        #include <blis.h>
        // Call BLIS functions using std::complex<double> here.
    
    - Fixed a bug in the definition of some scalar level-0 macros, since
      bli_creal()/bli_cimag() and bli_zreal()/bli_zimag() are no longer
      interchangeable.

    Added 'sifive_x280' subconfig, kernel set. (#737)
    
    Details:
    - Added a new 'sifive_x280' subconfiguration for SiFive's x280 RISC-V
      instruction set architecture. The subconfig registers kernels from a
      correspondingly new kernel set, also named 'sifive_x280'.
    - Added the aforementioned kernel set, which includes intrinsics- and
      assembly-based implementations of most level-1v kernels along with
      level-1f kernels axpy2v dotaxpyv, packm kernels, and level-3 gemm,
      gemmtrsm_l, and gemmtrsm_u microkernels (plus supporting files).
    - Registered the 'sifive_x280' subconfig as belonging to a singleton
      family by the same name.
    - Added an entry to '.travis.yml' to test the new subconfig via qemu.
    - Updates to 'travis/do_riscv.sh' script to support the 'sifive_x280'
      subconfig and to reflect updated tarball names.
    - Special thanks to Lee Killough, Devin Matthews, and Angelika Schwarz
      for their engagement on this commit.

    Fixed HPX barrier synchronization (#783)
    
    Details:
    - Fixed hpx barrier synchronization. HPX was hanging on larger cores
      because blis was using non-hpx synchronization primitives. But when
      using hpx-runtime only hpx-synchronization primitives should be used.
      Hence, a C style wrapper hpx_barrier_t is introduced to perform hpx
      barrier operations.
    - Replaced hpx::for_loop with hpx::futures. Using hpx::for_loop with
      hpx::barrier on n_threads greater than actual hardware thread count
      causes synchronization issues making hpx hanging. This can be avoided
      by using hpx::futures, which are relatively very lightweight, robust
      and scalable.

    Fixed bug in sup threshold registration. (#782)
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug that resulted in BLIS non-deterministically calling the
      gemmsup handler, irrespective of the thresholds that are registered
      via bli_cntx_set_blkszs().
    - Deep dive: In bli_cntx_init_ref.c, the default values for the gemmsup
      thresholds (BLIS_[MNK]T blocksizes) wre being set to zero so that no
      operation ever matched the criteria for gemmsup (unless specific sup
      thresholds are registered). HOWEVER, these thresholds are set via
      bli_cntx_set_blkszs() which calls bli_blksz_copy_if_pos(), which was
      only coping the thresholds into the gks' cntx_t if the values were
      strictly positive. Thus, the zero values passed into
      bli_cntx_set_blkszs() were being ignored and those threshold slots
      within the gks were left uninitialized. The upshot of this is that the
      reference gemmsup handler was being called for gemm problems
      essentially at random (and as it turns out, very rarely the reference
      gemmsup implementation would encounter a divide-by-zero error).
    - The problem was fixed by changing bli_blksz_copy_if_pos() so that it
      copies values that are non-negative (values >= 0 instead of > 0). The
      function was also renamed to bli_blksz_copy_if_nonneg()
    - Also needed to standardize use of -1 as the sole value to embed into
      blksz_t structs as a signal to bli_cntx_set_blkszs() to *not* register
      a value for that slot (and instead let whatever existing values
      remain). This required updates to the bli_cntx_init_*() functions for
      bgq, cortexa9, knc, penryn, power7, and template subconfigs, as some
      of these codes were using 0 instead of -1.
    - Fixes #781. Thanks to Devin Matthews for identifying, diagnosing, and
      proposing a fix for this issue.

    Fixed brokenness when sba is disabled. (#777)
    
    Details:
    - Previously, disabling the sba via --disable-sba-pools resulted in a
      segfault due to a sanity-check-triggering abort(). The problem was
      that the sba, as currently used in the l3 thread decorators, did not
      yet (fully) support pools being disabled. The solution entailed
      creating wrapper function, bli_sba_array_elem(), which either calls
      bli_apool_array_elem() (when sba pools are enabled at configure time)
      or returns a NULL sba_pool pointer (when sba pools are disabled), and
      calling bli_sba_array_elem() in place of bli_apool_array_elem(). Note
      that the NULL pointer returned by bli_sba_array_elem() when the sba
      pools are disabled does no harm since in that situation the pointer
      goes unreferenced when acquiring and releasing small blocks. Thanks to
      John Mather for reporting this bug.
    - Guarded the bodies of bli_sba_init() and bli_sba_finalize() with
      #ifdef BLIS_ENABLE_SBA_POOLS. I don't think this was actually necessary
      to fix the aforementioned bug, but it seems like good practice.
    - Moved the code in bli_l3_thrinfo_create() that checked that the array*
      pointer is non-NULL before calling bli_sba_array_elem() (previously
      bli_apool_array_elem()) into the definition of bli_sba_array_elem().
    - Renamed various instances of 'pool' variables and function parameters
      to 'sba_pool' to emphasize what kind of pool it represents.
    - Whitespace changes.

    Implemented [cz]symv_(), [cz]syr_(), [cz]rot_(). (#778)
    
    Details:
    - Expanded existing BLAS compatibility APIs to provide interfaces to
      [cz]symv_(), [cz]syr_(). This was easy since those operations were
      already implemented natively in BLIS; the APIs were previously
      omitted only because they were not formally part of the BLAS.
    - Implemented [cz]rot_() by feeding code from LAPACK 3.11 through
      f2c.
    - Thanks to James Foster for pointing out that LAPACK contains these
      additional symbols, which prompted these additions, as well as for
      testing the [cz]rot_() functions from Julia's test infrastructure.
    - CREDITS file update.

    Added 'altra', 'altramax' subconfigs. (#775)
    
    Details:
    - Forward-ported 'altra' and 'altramax' subconfigurations from the
      older 'stable' branch lineage [1]. These subconfigs primarily target
      the Ampere Altra and AltraMax (ARM) processors. They also contain
      "QuickStart" directories with information and scripts to help
      use BLIS on these microarchitectures. Thanks to Jeff Diamond and
      Leick Robinson for developing these subconfigs and resources.
    - Updated kernels/armv8a/3/bli_gemm_armv8a_asm_d6x8.c according to
      changes in the 'stable' lineage, mostly related to re-enabling of
      assembly code branches that target general stride IO.
    
    [1] Note that the 'stable' branch is being used to make sure that more
        recent commits do not introduce unreasonable performance
        regressions. As such, the name should be interpreted as shorthand
        for "performance stable," not "API stable."

    Fixes to HPC runtime code path. (#773)
    
    Details:
    - Fixed hpx::for_each invocation and replace with hpx::for_loop. The HPX
      runtime was initialized using hpx::start, but the hpx::for_each
      function was being called on a non-hpx runtime (i.e standard BLIS
      runtime - single main thread). To run hpx::for_each on HPX runtime
      correctly, the code now uses hpx::run_as_hpx_thread(func, args...).
    - Replaced hpx::for_each with hpx::for_loop, which eliminates use of
      hpx::util::counting_iterator.
    - Employ hpx::execution::chunk_size(1) to make sure that a thread
      resides on a particular core.
    - Replaced hpx::apply() with updated version hpx::post().
    - Initialize tdata->id = 0 in libblis.c to 0, as it is the main thread
      and is needed for writing results to output file.
    - By default, if not specified, the HPX runtime uses all N threads/cores
      available in the system. But, if we want to only specify n_threads out
      N threads, we use hpx::execution::experimental::num_cores(n_threads).

    Revamped bli_init() to use TLS where feasible. (#767)
    
    Details:
    - Revamped bli_init_apis() and bli_finalize_apis() to use separate
      bli_pthread_switch_t objects for each of the five sub-API init
      functions, with the objects for the 'ind' and 'rntm' sub-APIs being
      declared with BLIS_THREAD_LOCAL. This allows some APIs to be treated
      as thread-local and the rest as thread-shared. Thanks to Edward Smyth
      for requesting application thread-specific rntm_t structs, which
      inspired these change.
    - Combined bli_thread_init_from_env() and bli_pack_init_from_env() into
      a new function, bli_rntm_init_rntm_from_env(), and placed the combined
      code in bli_rntm.c inside of a new bli_rntm_init() function. Then
      removed the (now empty) bli_pack_init() and _finalize() function defs.
    - Deprecated bli_rntm_init() for the purposes of initializing a rntm_t
      (temporarily preserving it as bli_rntm_clear() in a cpp-undefined code
      block) so that the function name could be used for the aforementioned
      bli_rntm_init() function.
    - Updated libblis_test_pobj_create() in test_libblis.c to use a static
      rntm_t initializer instead of the deprecated bli_rntm_init()
      function-based option.
    - Minor updates to docs/Multithreading.md, including removal of
      bli_rntm_init() in the example of how to initialize rntm_t structs.
    - Changed the return value of bli_gks_init(), bli_ind_init(),
      bli_memsys_init(), bli_thread_init(), and bli_rntm_init() (and their
      finalize() counterparts) from 'void' to 'int' so that those functions
      match the function type expected by bli_pthread_switch_on()/_off().
      Those init/finalize functions now return 0 to indicate success, which
      is needed so that the switch actually changes state from off to on
      and vice versa.
    - Defined bli_thread_reset(), which copies the contents of the
      global_rntm_at_init() struct into the global_rntm struct (for the
      current application thread).
    - Guard calls to bli_pthread_mutex_lock()/_unlock() in
      - bli_pack_set_pack_a() and _pack_b()
      - bli_rntm_init_from_global()
      - bli_thread_set_ways()
      - bli_thread_set_num_threads()
      - bli_thread_set_thread_impl()
      - bli_thread_reset()
      - bli_l3_ind_oper_set_enable()
      with #ifdef BLIS_DISABLE_TLS (since TLS precludes the possibility of
      race conditions).
    - In frame/base/bli_rntm.c, declare global_rntm, global_rntm_at_init,
      and global_rntm_mutex as BLIS_THREAD_LOCAL so that separate
      application threads can change the number of ways of BLIS parallelism
      independently from one another.
    - Access global_rntm only via a new private (not exported) function,
      bli_global_rntm(). Defined a similar function for a rntm_t new to
      this commit, global_rntm_at_init, which preserves the state of the
      global rntm at initialization-time.
    - In frame/3/bli_l3_ind.c, added a guard to the declaration of the
      static variable oper_st_mutex with #ifdef BLIS_DISABLE_TLS so that the
      mutex is omitted altogether when TLS is enabled (which prevents the
      compiler from warning about an unused variable).
    - Removed redundant code from bli_thread.c:
        #ifdef BLIS_ENABLE_HPX
        #include "bli_thread_hpx.h"
        #endif
      since this code is already present in bli_thread.h.
    - Thanks to Minh Quan Ho for his review of and feedback on this commit.
    - Comment updates.

    Fixed error when using common.mk from testsuite. (#768)
    
    Details:
    - Commit 2db31e0 (#755) inserted logic into common.mk that attempts to
      preprocess build/detect/android/bionic.h to determine whether the
      __BIONIC__ macro is defined (in which case -lrt should not be included
      in LDFLAGS). However, the path to bionic.h was encoded without regard
      to DIST_PATH, and so utilizing common.mk anywhere that isn't the top-
      level directory (such as in the testsuite directory) resulted in a
      compiler error:
    
        gcc: error: build/detect/android/bionic.h: No such file or directory
        gcc: fatal error: no input files
        compilation terminated.
    
      This commit adds a $(DIST_PATH) prefix to the path to bionic.h so that
      it can be located from other applications' Makefiles that use BLIS's
      makefile fragments.

    Set thrcomm timpl_t id inside init functions. (#766)
    
    Details:
    - Previously, the timpl_t id being used when a thrcomm_t is being
      initialized was set within the bli_thrcomm_init() dispatch function
      after the timpl_t-specific bli_thrcomm_init_*() function returned. But
      it just occurred to me that each bli_thrcomm_init_*() function already
      intrinsically knows its own timpl_t value. This commit shifts the
      setting of the thrcomm_t.ti field into the corresponding
      bli_thrcomm_init_*() function for each timpl_t type (e.g. single,
      openmp, pthreads, hpx).
    - Removed long-deprecated code dating back nearly 10 years.
    - Whitespace changes
    - Comment updates.

    Auto-detect the RISC-V ABI of the compiler and use -mabi= during RISC-V Builds (#750)
    
    Details:
    - Generate a build error if there is a 32/64-bit mismatch between the
      RISC-V ABI or architecture and the BLIS configuration selected.
    - Handle Q, Zicsr, ZiFencei, Zba, Zbb, Zbc, Zbs and Zfh extensions in
      the RISC-V architecture auto-detection. ZiFencei and Zicsr is not
      detectable with built-in RISC-V macros right now.
    - ZiFencei is not important for BLIS because doesn't it have
      Just-In-Time compilation or self-modifying code, and Zicsr is implied
      by the floating-point extensions, which are required for good
      performance in BLIS.
    - Move RISC-V autodetect header files to build/detect/riscv/.

    - Wrote an alternative to regen-symbols.sh, gen-libblis-symbols.sh,
      that generates a list of exported symbols from the monolithic blis.h
      file rather than peeking inside of the shared object via nm. (This new
      script lives in the 'build' directory and the older script has been
      retired to build/old.) Special thanks to Devin Matthews for authoring
      gen-libblis-symbols.sh.
    - Added a 'symbols' target to the top-level Makefile which will refresh
      build/libblis-symbols.def, with supporting changes to common.mk.
    - Updates to build/libblis-symbols.def using the new symbol-generating
      script.

    Rewrote/fixed broken tree barrier implementation.
    
    Details:
    - Rewrote the defintion of bli_thrcomm_tree_barrier() so that it (a)
      actually worked again, and (b) used atomics instead of a basic C99
      spin loop. (Note that the conventional barrier implementation is
      still enabled by default; the tree barrier must be toggled on
      manually within the configuration.)
    - Added an early return to the definition of bli_thrcomm_barrier() in
      the cases where comm == NULL or comm->n_threads == 1.
    - Reordered thread-related and thread-dependent header #include
      directives in blis.h so that the BLIS_TREE_BARRIER and
      BLIS_TREE_BARRIER_ARITY macros, which would be defined in the target
      configuration's in the bli_family_*.h file, would be #included prior
      to the inclusion of the thrcomm_t header that uses them.
    - Changed the type of barrier_t.count from 'int' to 'dim_t'.
    - Changed the type of barrier_t.signal from 'volatile int' to 'gint_t'.
    - Special thanks to Leick Robinson for contributing these changes.
    - Whitespace changes.

    - Inserted a cache line of padding between various fields of the
      thrcomm_t and, in the case of the (presently defunct) tree barrier,
      fields of the barrier_t. This additional padding ensures that these
      fields, which both serve different purposes when performing a thread
      barrier, are only accessed when needed (and not just due to their
      spatial locality with their cache line neighbors).
    - Added a new cpp macro constant, BLIS_CACHE_LINE_SIZE, to
      bli_config_macro_defs. This new constant defines the size of a cache
      line (in bytes) and defaults to 64.
    - Special thanks to Leick Robinson for discovering this false sharing
      issue and developing/submitting the patch.

    Fix 1m enablement for herk/her2k/syrk/syr2k. (#743)
    
    Details:
    - Ever since 28b0982, herk, her2k, syrk, and syr2k have been implemented
      in terms of the gemmt expert API. And since the decision of which
      induced method to use (1m or native) is made *below* the level of the
      expert API, executing any of {herk,her2k,syrk,syr2k} results in BLIS
      checking the enablement status for gemmt.
    - This commit applies a band-aid of sorts to this issue by modifying
      bli_l3_ind_oper_get_enable() and bli_l3_ind_oper_set_enable() so that
      any attempts to query or modify the internal enablement status for
      herk, her2k, syrk, or syr2k instead does so for gemmt.
    - This solution isn't perfect since, in theory, the user could enable 1m
      for, say, herk but then disable it for syrk, and then be confused when
      herk runs via native execution. But we don't anticipate that users
      modify 1m enablement at the operation level, and so in practice this
      solution is likely fine for now.

    add nvhpc compiler support (#719)
    
    Add detection of the NVIDIA nvhpc compiler (`nvc`) in `configure`, and adjust some warning options in `config.mk`. Currently, no specific options for `nvc` have been added in the relevant configurations so it may not be usable without further tweaks.

    Consolidate INSERT_ macro sets via variadic macros. (#744)
    
    Details:
    - Consolidated INSERT_GENTFUNC_* (and corresponding GENTPROT) macro sets
      using variadic macros (__VA_ARGS__), which means we no longer need a
      different INSERT_ macro for each possible number of arguments the
      macro might take. This change seems reasonable given that variadic
      macros are a standard C99 feature and widely supported. I took care
      not to use variadic macros where 0 variadic arguments are expected
      since that is a non-standard extension.
    - Added pre-typecast parentheses to arithmetic expressions in printf()
      statements in bli_thread_range_tlb.c.

    Apply #738 to make_defs.mk of RISC-V subconfigs. (#740)
    
    Details:
    - PR #738 -- which moved -fPIC flag insertion responsibilities from
      common.mk to the subconfigs' individual make_defs.mk files -- was
      merged shortly before the introduction of new RISC-V subconfigs in
      #693. This commit brings those RISC-V subconfigs up to date with the
      new -fPIC conventions.

    Add RISC-V target (#693)
    
    Details:
    - There are four RISC-V base configurations: 'rv32i', 'rv32iv', 'rv64i',
      and 'rv64iv', namely the 32-bit and 64-bit implementations with and
      without the 'V' vector extension. Additional extensions such as 'M'
      (multiplication), 'A' (atomics), 'F' ('float' hardware support), 'D'
      ('double' hardware support), and 'C' (compressed-length instructions),
      are automatically used when available. If they are not available, then
      software equivalents (e.g., softfloat and -latomic) are used.
    - './configure auto' can be invoked on a RISC-V build platform, and will
      automatically detect RISC-V CPU extensions through the RISC-V C API:
      https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-c-api-doc/blob/master/riscv-c-api.md
    - The assembly kernels assume the presence of the vector extension
      RVV 1.0.
    - It is possible to build 'rv[32,64]iv' for any value of VLEN.
      However, if VLEN < 128, the targets will fall back to the generic
      kernels and blocksizes.
    - The vector microkernels are vector-length agnostic and work with
      every VLEN >=128, but are expected to work best with smaller vector
      lengths, i.e., VLEN <= 512.
    - The assembly kernels cover column major storage (rs_c == 1).
    - The blocksizes aim at being a good generic choice for out-of-order
      cores. They are not tuned to a specific RISC-V HPC core.
    - The vector kernels have been tested using vlen={128,256,512}.
    - The single- and double-precision assembly code routines for 'sgemm'
      and 'dgemm', or for 'cgemm' and 'zgemm', are combined in their RISC-V
      vector assembly source code, and are differentiated only with macros.
    - The XLEN=32 and XLEN=64 versions of the RISC-V assembly code are
      identical, except that callee-saved registers are saved and restored
      differently. There are RISC-V assembly code #include files for
      handling the saving and restoring of callee-saved registers, and they
      are future-proof if ever XLEN=128.
    - Multiplications, such as computing array strides and offsets, are
      performed in C, and later passed to the RISC-V assembly kernels. This
      is so that the compiler can determine whether the 'M' (multiply)
      extension is available and use multiplication instructions, or call
      library helper functions instead.
    - A new macro called bli_static_assert() has been added to perform
      static assertions at compile-time, regardless of the C/C++ dialect of
      the compiler. The original motivation of this was to ensure that
      calling RISC-V assembly kernels would not silently truncate arguments
      of type 'dim_t' or 'inc_t' (so-called "narrowing conversions").
    - RISC-V CI tests have been added to Travis CI, using the
      riscv-gnu-toolchain cross-compiler, and qemu simulator.
    - Thanks to Lee Killough for collaborating on this commit.

    Optionally disable thread-local storage. (#735)
    
    Details:
    - Implemented a new configure option, --disable-tls, which allows the
      user to optionally disable the use of thread-local storage qualifiers
      on static variables in BLIS. This option will rarely be needed, but
      in some situations may allow BLIS to compile when TLS is unavailable.
      Thanks to Nick Knight for suggesting this option.
    - Unlike the --disable-system option, --disable-tls does not forcibly
      disable threading. Instead, warnings of the possible consequences of
      using threading with TLS disabled are added to:
      - the output of './configure --help';
      - the output of 'configure' the --disable-tls option is parsed;
      - the informational header output by the testsuite.
      Thanks to Minh Quan Ho for suggesting these warnings.
    - Modified frame/include/bli_lang_defs.h so that BLIS_THREAD_LOCAL is
      defined to nothing when BLIS_ENABLE_TLS is not defined.
    - Defined bli_info_get_enable_tls(), which returns whether the cpp macro
      BLIS_ENABLE_TLS was defined.
    - Edited --disable-system configure status output for clarity.
    - Whitespace updates.

    Move -fPIC insertion to subconfigs' make_defs.mk. (#738)
    
    * Move -fPIC insertion to subconfigs' make_defs.mk.
    
    Details:
    - Previously, common.mk was appending -fPIC to the CPICFLAGS variables
      set within the various subconfigurations' make_defs.mk files. This
      seemed somewhat unintuitive, and so now the -fPIC flag is assigned to
      the various subconfigs' CPICFLAGS variables in the respective
      make_defs.mk files.
    - This also commit changes the logic in common.mk so that instead of
      appending, the variable is overwritten, but now *only* in the case
      of Windows (since apparently -fPIC needs to be omitted there). Thanks
      to Nick Knight for catching and reporting this weirdness.

    Fixed compile errors with `BLIS_DISABLE_BLAS_DEFS`. (#730)
    
    * Fixed compile errors with BLIS_DISABLE_BLAS_DEFS.
    
    Details:
    - This commit fixes a compile-time error related to the type definition
      (prototype) of dsdot_() when BLIS_DISABLE_BLAS_DEFS is defined by the
      application (or the configuration), which is actually a symptom of a
      larger design issue when disabling BLAS prototypes. The macro was
      intended to allow applications to bring their own BLAS prototypes and
      suppress the inclusion of duplicate (or possibly conflicting)
      prototypes within blis.h. However, prototypes are still needed during
      compilation even if they are ultimately omitted from blis.h. The
      problem is that almost every source file in BLIS--including the BLAS
      compatibility layer--only includes one header (blis.h), and if we
      were to #include a new header in the BLAS source files (to isolate
      only the BLAS prototypes), we would also have to make the build system
      aware of the location of those headers. Thanks to Edward Smyth of AMD
      for reporting this issue.
    - The solution I settled upon was to remove all cpp guards from all BLAS
      headers (by changing them to #if 1, for easy search-and-replace
      anchoring in the future if we ever need to re-insert guards) and
      modifying bli_blas.h so that the BLAS prototypes are #included if
      either (a) BLIS_ENABLE_BLAS_DEFS is defined, or (b)
      BLIS_ENABLE_BLAS_DEFS is *not* defined but BLIS_IS_BUILDING_LIBRARY
      *is* defined. (Thanks to Devin Matthews for steering me away from an
      inferior solution.)
    - This commit also spins off the actual BLAS prototypes/definitions to
      a separate file, bli_blas_defs.h.
    - CREDITS file update.

    Omit -fPIC if shared library build is disabled. (#732)
    
    Details:
    - Updated common.mk so that when --disable-shared option is given to
      configure:
      1. The -fPIC compiler flag is omitted from the individual
         configuration family members' CPICFLAGS variables (which are
         initialized in each subconfig's make_defs.mk file); and
      2. The BUILD_SYMFLAGS variable, which contains compiler flags needed
         to control the symbol export behavior, is left blank.
    - The net result of these changes is that flags specific to shared
      library builds are only used when a shared library is actually
      scheduled to be built. Thanks to Nick Knight for reporting this issue.
    - CREDITS file update.

    Fixed bugs in scal2v ref kernel when alpha == 1. (#728)
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a typo bug in ref_kernels/1/bli_scal2v_ref.c where the
      conditional that was supposed to be checking for cases when alpha is
      equal to 1.0 (so that copyv could be used instead of scal2v) was
      instead erroneously comparing alpha against 0.0.
    - Fixed another bug in the same function whereby BLIS_NO_CONJUGATE was
      erroneously being passed into copyv instead of the kernel's conjx
      parameter. This second bug was inert, however, due to the first bug
      since the "alpha == 0.0" case was already being handled, resulting in
      the code block never executing.

    Use 'void*' datatypes in kernel APIs. (#727)
    
    Details:
    - Migrated all kernel APIs to use void* pointers instead of float*,
      double*, scomplex*, and dcomplex* pointers. This allows us to define
      many fewer kernel function pointer types, which also makes it much
      easier to know which function pointer type to use at any given time.
      (For example, whereas before there was ?axpyv_ker_ft, ?axpyv_ker_vft,
      and axpyv_ker_vft, now there is just axpyv_ker_ft, which is equivalent
      so what axpyv_ker_vft used to be.)
    - Refactored how kernel function prototypes and kernel function types
      are defined so as to reduce redundant code. Specifically, the
      function signatures (excluding cntx_t* and, in the case of level-3
      microkernels, auxinfo_t*) are defined in new headers named, for
      example, bli_l1v_ker_params.h. Those signatures are reused via macro
      instantiation when defining both kernel prototypes and kernel function
      types. This will hopefully make it a little easier to update, add, and
      manage kernel APIs going forward.
    - Updated all reference kernels according to the aforementioned switch
      to void* pointers.
    - Updated all optimzied kernels according to the aforementioned switch
      to void* pointers. This sometimes required renaming variables,
      inserting typecasting so that pointer arithmetic could continue to
      function as intended, and related tweaks.
    - Updated sandbox/gemmlike according to the aforementioned switch to
      void* pointers.
    - Renamed:
      - frame/1/bli_l1v_ft_ker.h    -> frame/1/bli_l1v_ker_ft.h
      - frame/1f/bli_l1f_ft_ker.h   -> frame/1f/bli_l1f_ker_ft.h
      - frame/1m/bli_l1m_ft_ker.h   -> frame/1m/bli_l1m_ker_ft.h
      - frame/3/bli_l1m_ft_ukr.h    -> frame/3/bli_l1m_ukr_ft.h
      - frame/3/bli_l3_sup_ft_ker.h -> frame/3/bli_l3_sup_ker_ft.h
      to better align with naming of neighboring files.
    - Added the missing "void* params" argument to bli_?packm_struc_cxk() in
      frame/1m/packm/bli_packm_struc_cxk.c. This argument is being passed
      into the function from bli_packm_blk_var1(), but wasn't being "caught"
      by the function definition itself. The function prototype for
      bli_?packm_struc_cxk() also needed updating.
    - Reordered the last two parameters in bli_?packm_struc_cxk().
      (Previously, the "void* params" was passed in after the
      "const cntx_t* cntx", although because of the above bug the params
      argument wasn't actually present in the function definition.)

    Use 'const' pointers in kernel APIs. (#722)
    
    Details:
    - Qualified all input-only data pointers in the various kernel APIs with
      the 'const' keyword while also removing 'restrict' from those kernel
      APIs. (Use of 'restrict' was maintained in kernel implementations,
      where appropriate.) This affected the function pointer types defined
      for all of the kernels, their prototypes, and the reference and
      optimized kernel definitions' signatures.
    - Templatized the definitions of copys_mxn and xpbys_mxn static inline
      functions.
    - Minor whitespace and style changes (e.g. combining local variable
      declaration and initialization into a single statement).
    - Removed some unused kernel code left in 'old' directories.
    - Thanks to Nisanth M P for helping to validate changes to the power10
      microkernels.

    Restored ArmSVE general storage case. (#708)
    
    Details:
    - Restored general storage case in armsve kernels.
    - Reason for doing this: Though real `g`-storage is difficult to
      speedup, `g`-codepath here can provide a good support for
      transposed-storage. i.e. at least good for `GEMM_UKR_SETUP_CT_AMBI`.
    - By experience, this solution is only *a little* slower than in-reg
      transpose. Plus in-reg transpose is only possible for a fixed VL in
      our case.

    - Added a new 'arm64' entry to the .travis.yml file in an attempt to get
      Travis CI to compile both NEON and SVE kernels, even if only NEON
      kernels are exercised in the testing. With this new 'arm64' entry, the
      'cortexa57' entry becomes redundant and may be removed. Thanks to
      RuQing Xu for this suggestion.
    - Previously, the macro BLIS_SIMD_MAX_SIZE was *not* being set in
      bli_kernels_arm64.h, which meant that the default value of 64 was
      being used. This caused a runtime consistency check to fail in
      bli_gks.c (in Travis CI), one which requires that
    
        mr * nr * dt_size > BLIS_STACK_BUF_MAX_SIZE
    
      for all datatype sizes dt_size, where BLIS_STACK_BUF_MAX_SIZE is
      defined as
    
        BLIS_SIMD_MAX_NUM_REGISTERS * BLIS_SIMD_MAX_SIZE * 2
    
      This commit increases BLIS_SIMD_MAX_SIZE to 128 for the 'arm64'
      configuration, thus overriding the default and (hopefully) avoiding
      the aforementioned consistency check failures.
    - Appended '|| cat ./output.testsuite' to all 'make' commands in
      travis/do_testsuite.sh. Thanks to RuQing Xu for this suggestion.
    - Whitespace changes.

    Redirect grep stderr to /dev/null. (#723)
    
    Details:
    - In common.mk, added a redirection of stderr to /dev/null for the grep
      command being used to gather a list of header files #included from
      bli_cntx_ref.c. The redirection is desirable because as of grep 3.8,
      regular expressions with "stray" backslashes trigger warnings [1].
      But removing the backslash seems to break the BLIS build system when
      using pre-3.8 versions of grep, so this seems to be easiest way to
      satisfy the BLIS build system for both pre- and post-3.8 grep
      environments.

    Added runtime selection of 'power' config family. (#718)
    
    Details:
    - Created a 'power' umbrella configuration family, which, when targeted
      at configure-time, will build both 'power9' and 'power10' subconfigs.
      (With this feature, a BLIS shared library could be compiled on a
      power9 system and run on power10 and vice-versa. Unoptimised code
      will execute if it is linked and run on any other generic system.)
    - This new configuration family will only work with gcc, since that is
      the only compiler supported by both power9 and power10 subconfigs in
      BLIS.
    - Documented power9 and power10 as supported microarchitectures in the
      docs/HardwareSupport.md document.

    Define `BLIS_VERSION_STRING` in `blis.h`. (#720)
    
    Details:
    - Previously, the version string was communicated from configure to
      config.mk (via the config.mk.in template), where it was included via
      the top-level Makefile, where it was then used to define the
      preprocessor macro BLIS_VERSION_STRING via a command line argument to
      the compiler (via -D). This macro is then used within bli_info.c to
      initialize a static string which can then be queried via the
      bli_info_get_version_str() function. However, there are some
      applications that may find utility in being able to access the version
      string by inspecting the monolithic (flattened) blis.h header file
      that is created at compile time and installed alongside the library.
      This commit moves the definition of BLIS_VERSION_STRING into
      bli_config.h (via the bli_config.h.in template) so that it is
      embedded in blis.h. The version string is now available in three
      places:
      - the static/shared library, which is installed in the 'lib'
        subdirectory of the install prefix (query-able via the
        bli_info_get_version_str() function);
      - the config.mk makefile fragment, which is installed in the 'share'
        subdirectory of the install prefix (in the VERSION variable);
      - the blis.h header file, which is installed in the 'include'
        subdirectory of the install prefix (via the BLIS_VERSION_STRING
        macro constant).
      Thanks to Mohsen Aznaveh and Tim Davis for providing the idea for this
      change.
    - CREDITS file update.

    Typecast printf() args to avoid compiler warnings. (#716)
    
    Details:
    - In bli_thread_range_tlb.c, typecast integer arguments passed to
      printf() -- which are typically disabled unless debugging -- to type
      "long" to guarantee a match to the "%ld" format specifiers used in
      those calls. This avoids spurious warnings with certain compilers in
      certain toolchain environments, such as 32-bit RISC-V (rv32iv).

    Use here-document for 'configure --help' output. (#714)
    
    Details:
    - Changed the configure script function that outputs "--help" text to do
      so via so-called "here-document" syntax for improved readability and
      maintainability. The change eliminates hundreds of echo statements and
      makes it easier to change existing configure options' help text, along
      with other benefits such as eliminating the need to escape double-
      quote characters (").

    Merge tlb- and slab/rr-specific gemm macrokernels. (#711)
    
    Details:
    - Merged the tlb-specific gemm macrokernel (_var2b) with the slab/rr-
      specific one (var2) so that a single function can be compiled with
      either tlb or slab/rr support, depending on the value of the
      BLIS_ENABLE_JRIR_TLB, _SLAB, and _RR. This is done by incorporating
      information from both approaches: the start/end/inc for the JR and IR
      loops from slab or rr partitioning; and the number of assigned
      microtiles, plus the starting IR dimension offset for all iterations
      after the first (ir_next). With these changes, slab, rr, and tlb can
      all be parameterized by initializing a similar set of variables prior
      to the jr loop.
    - Removed the wrap-around logic that sets the "b_next" field of the
      auxinfo_t struct, which executes during the last IR iteration of the
      last JR iteration. The potential benefit of this code is so minor
      (and hinges on the microkernel making use of the b_next field) that
      it's arguably not worth including. The code also does the wrong
      thing for some threads whenever JR_NT > 1, since only thread 0 (in the
      JR group) would even compute with the first micropanel of B.
    - Re-expressed the definition of bli_is_last_iter_slrr so that slab and
      tlb use the same code rather than rr and tlb.
    - Adjusted the initialization of the gemm control tree accordingly.

    Fixed mis-mapped instruction for VEXTRACTF64X2. (#713)

    - This commit fixes a typo in the macro definition for the extended
      inline assembly macro VEXTRACTF64X2 in bli_x86_asm_macros.h. The macro
      was previously defined (incorrectly) in terms of the vextractf64x4

    Defined lt, lte, gt, gte + misc. other updates. (#712)
    
    Details:
    - Changed invertsc operation to be a non-destructive operation; that is,
      it now takes separate input and output operands. This change applies
      to both the object and typed APIs.
    - Defined an alternative square root operation, sqrtrsc, which, when
      operating on complex scalars, assumes the imaginary part of the input
      to be zero.
    - Changed the semantics of addm, subm, copym, axpym, scal2m, and xpbym
      so that when the source matrix has an implicit unit diagonal, the
      operation leaves the diagonal of the destination matrix untouched.
      Previously, the operations would interpret an implicit unit diagonal
      on the source matrix as a request to manifest the unit diagonal
      *explicitly* on output (either as something to copy in the case of
      copym, or something to compute with in the cases of addm, subm, axpym,
      scal2m, and xpbym). It turns out that this behavior was too cute by
      half and could cause unintended headaches for practical use cases.
      (This change in behavior also required small modifications to the trmv
      and trsv testsuite modules so that they would properly test matrices
      with unit diagonals.)
    - Added missing dependencies for copym to gemv, ger, hemv, trmv, and
      trsv testsuite modules.
    - Implemented level-0-like ltsc, ltesc, gtsc, gtesc operations in
      frame/util, which use lt, lte, gt, and gte level-0 scalar macros.
    - Trivial variable rename in bli_part.c to harmonize with other
      variable naming conventions.

    Implement cntx_t pointer caching in gks. (#709)
    
    Details:
    - Refactored the gks cntx_t query functions so that: (1) there is a
      clearer pattern of similarity between functions that query a native
      context and those that query its induced (1m) counterpart; and (2)
      queried cntx_t pointers (for both native and induced cntx_t pointers)
      are cached (by default), or deep-queried upon each invocation,
      depending on whether cpp macro BLIS_ENABLE_GKS_CACHING is defined.
    - Refactored query-related functions in bli_arch.c to cache the queried
      arch_t value (by default), or deep-query the arch_t value upon each
      invocation, depending on whether cpp macro BLIS_ENABLE_GKS_CACHING is
      defined.
    - Tweaked the behavior of bli_gks_query_ind_cntx_impl() (formerly named
      bli_gks_query_ind_cntx()) so that the induced method cntx_t struct is
      repopulated each time the function is called. (It is still only
      allocated once on first call.) This was mostly done in preparation for
      some future in which the arch_t value might change at runtime. In such
      a scenario, the induced method context would need to be recalculated
      any time the native context changes.
    - Added preprocessor logic to bli_config_macro_defs.h to handle enabling
      or disabling of cntx_t pointer caching (via BLIS_ENABLE_GKS_CACHING).
    - For now, cntx_t pointer caching is enabled by default and does not
      correspond to any official configure option. Disabling can be done
      by inserting a #define for BLIS_DISABLE_GKS_CACHING into the
      appropriate bli_family_*.h header file within the configuration of
      interest.
    - Thanks to Harihara Sudhan S (AMD) for suggesting that cntxt_t pointers
      (and not just arch_t values) be cached.
    - Comment updates.

    Fixing type-mismatch errors in power10 sandbox (#701)
    
    Details:
    - This commit fixes a mismatch between the function type signature of
      bli_gemm_ex() required by BLIS and the version of the function defined
      within the power10 sandbox. It also performs typecasting upon calling
      bli_gemm_front() to attain type consistency with the type signature
      defined by BLIS for bli_gemm_front().

    Disable power10 kernels other than sgemm, dgemm. (#705)
    
    Details:
    - There is a power10 sandbox which uses microkernels for datatypes other
      than float and double (or scomplex/dcomplex). In a regular power10-
      configured build (that is, with the sandbox disabled), there were
      compile errors for some of these other non-sgemm/non-dgemm
      microkernels. This commit protects those kernels with a new cpp macro
      guard (which is defined in sandbox/power10/bli_sandbox.h) that
      prevents that kernel code from being compiled for normal, non-sandbox
      power10 builds.

    Details:
    - When power10 sgemm and dgemm microkernels are called with k = 0, they

      early exit in the case of k = 0.

    Tile-level partitioning in jr/ir loops (ex-trsm). (#695)
    
    Details:
    - Reimplemented parallelization of the JR loop in gemmt (which is
      recycled for herk, her2k, syrk, and syr2k). Previously, the
      rectangular region of the current MC x NC panel of C would be
      parallelized separately from from the diagonal region of that same
      submatrix, with the rectangular portion being assigned to threads via
      slab or round-robin (rr) partitioning (as determined at configure-
      time) and the diagonal region being assigned via round-robin. This
      approach did not work well when extracting lots of parallelism from
      the JR loop and was often suboptimal even for smaller degrees of
      parallelism. This commit implements tile-level load balancing (tlb) in
      which the IR loop is effectively subjugated in service of more
      equitably dividing work in the JR loop. This approach is especially
      potent for certain situations where the diagonal region of the MC x NR
      panel of C are significant relative to the entire region. However, it
      also seems to benefit many problem sizes of other level-3 operations
      (excluding trsm, which has an inherent algorithmic dependency in the
      IR loop that prevents the application of tlb). For now, tlb is
      implemented as _var2b.c macrokernels for gemm (which forms the basis
      for gemm, hemm, and symm), gemmt (which forms the basis of herk,
      her2k, syrk, and syr2k), and trmm (which forms the basis of trmm and
      trmm3). Which function pointers (_var2() or _var2b()) are embedded in
      the control tree will depend on whether the BLIS_ENABLE_JRIR_TLB cpp
      macro is defined, which is controlled by the value passed to the
      existing --thread-part-jrir=METHOD (or -r METHOD) configure option.
      This script adds 'tlb' as a valid option alongside the previously
      supported values of 'slab' and 'rr'. ('slab' is still the default.)
      Thanks to Leick Robinson for abstractly inspiring this work, and to
      Minh Quan Ho for inquiring (in PR #562, and before that in Issue #437)
      about the possibility of improved load balance in macrokernel loops,
      and even prototyping what it might look like, long before I fully
      understood the problem.
    - In bli_thread_range_weighted_sub(), tweaked the the way we compute the
      area of the current MC x NC trapezoidal panel of C by better taking
      into account the microtile structure along the diagonal. Previously,
      it was an underestimate, as it assumed MR = NR = 1 (that is, it
      assumed that the microtile column of C that overlapped with microtiles
      exactly coincided with the diagonal). Now, we only assume MR = NR.
      This is still a slight underestimate when MR != NR, so the additional
      area is scaled by 1.5 in a hackish attempt to compensate for this, as
      well as other additional effects that are difficult to model (such as
      the increased cost of writing to temporary tiles before finally
      updating C). The net effect of this better estimation of the
      trapezoidal area should be (on average) slightly larger regions
      assigned to threads that have little or no overlap with the diagonal
      region (and correspondingly slightly smaller regions in the diagonal
      region), which we expect will lead to slightly better load balancing
      in most situations.
    - Spun off the contents of bli_thread.[ch] that relate to computing
      thread ranges into one of three source/header file pairs:
      - bli_thread_range.[ch], which define functions that are not specific
        to the jr/ir loops;
      - bli_thread_range_slab_rr.[ch], which define functions that implement
        slab or round-robin partitioning for the jr/ir loops;
      - bli_thread_range_tlb.[ch], which define functions that implement
        tlb for the jr/ir loops.
    - Fixed the computation of a_next in the last iteration of the IR loop
      in bli_gemmt_l_ker_var2(). Previously, it always "wrapped" back around
      to the first micropanel of the current MC x KC packed block of A.
      However, this is almost never actually the micropanel that is used
      next. A new macro, bli_gemmt_l_wrap_a_upanel(), computes a_next
      correctly, with a similarly named bli_gemmt_u_wrap_a_upanel() for use
      in the upper-stored case (which *does* actually always choose the
      first micropanel of A as its a_next at the end of the IR loop).
    - Removed adjustments for a_next/b_next (a2/b2) for the diagonal-
      intersecting case of gemmt_l_ker_var2() and the above-diagonal case
      of gemmt_u_ker_var2() since these cases will only coincide with the
      last iteration of the IR loop in very small problems.
    - Defined bli_is_last_iter_l() and bli_is_last_iter_u(), the latter of
      which explicitly considers whether the current microtile is the last
      tile that intersects the diagonal. (The former does the same, but the
      computation coincides with the original bli_is_last_iter().) These
      functions are now used in gemmt to test when a_next (or a2) should
      "wrap" (as discussed above). Also defined bli_is_last_iter_tlb_l()
      and bli_is_last_iter_tlb_u(), which are similar to the aforementioned
      functions but are used when employing tlb in gemmt.
    - Redefined macros in bli_packm_thrinfo.h, which test whether an
      iteration of work is assigned to a thread, as static inline functions
      in bli_param_macro_defs.h (and then deleted bli_packm_thrinfo.h).
      In the process of redefining these macros, I also renamed them from
      bli_packm_my_iter_rr/sl() to bli_is_my_iter_rr/sl().
    - Renamed
        bli_thread_range_jrir_rr() -> bli_thread_range_rr()
        bli_thread_range_jrir_sl() -> bli_thread_range_sl()
        bli_thread_range_jrir()    -> bli_thread_range_slrr()
    - Renamed
        bli_is_last_iter() -> bli_is_last_iter_slrr()
    - Defined
        bli_info_get_thread_jrir_tlb()
      and renamed:
      - bli_info_get_thread_part_jrir_slab() ->
        bli_info_get_thread_jrir_slab()
      - bli_info_get_thread_part_jrir_rr() ->
        bli_info_get_thread_jrir_rr()
    - Modified bli_rntm_set_ways_for_op() to redirect IR loop parallelism
      into the JR loop when tlb is enabled for non-trsm level-3 operations.
    - Added a sanity check to prevent bli_prune_unref_mparts() from being
      used on packed objects. This prohibition is necessary because the
      current implementation does not take into account the atomicity of
      packed micropanel widths relative to the diagonal of structured
      matrices. That is, the function prunes greedily without regard to
      whether doing so would prune off part of a micropanel *which has
      already been packed* and assigned to a thread for inclusion in the
      computation.
    - Further restricted early returns in bli_prune_unref_mparts() to
      situations where the primary matrix is not only of general structure
      but also dense (in terms of its uplo_t value). The addition of the
      matrix's dense-ness to the conditional is required because gemmt is
      somewhat unusual in that its C matrix has general structure but is
      marked as lower- or upper-stored via its uplo_t. By only checking
      for general structure, attempts to prune gemmt C matrices would
      incorrectly result in early returns, even though that operation
      effectively treats the matrix as symmetric (and stored in only one
      triangle).
    - Fixed a latent bug in bli_thread_range_rr() wherein incorrect ranges
      were computed when 1 < bf. Thankfully, this bug was not yet
      manifesting since all current invocations used bf == 1.
    - Fixed a latent bug in some unexercised code in bli_?gemmt_l_ker_var2()
      that would perform incorrect pruning of unreferenced regions above
      where the diagonal of a lower-stored matrix intersects the right edge.
      Thankfully, the bug was not harming anything since those unreferenced
      regions were being pruned prior to the macrokernel.
    - Rewrote slab/rr-based gemmt macrokernels so that they no longer carved
      C into rectangular and diagonal regions prior to parallelizing each
      separately. The new macrokernels use a unified loop structure where
      quadratic (slab) partitioning is used.
    - Updated all level-3 macrokernels to have a more uniform coding style,
      such as wrt combining variable declarations with initializations as
      well as the use of const.
    - Updated bls_l3_packm_var[123].c to use bli_thrinfo_n_way() and
      bli_thrinfo_work_id() instead of bli_thrinfo_num_threads() and
      bli_thrinfo_thread_id(), respectively. This change probably should
      have been included in aeb5f0c.
    - Removed old prototypes in bli_gemmt_var.h and bli_trmm_var.h that
      corresponded to functions that were removed in aeb5f0c.
    - Other very minor cleanups.
    - Comment updates.

    Refactor structure awareness in packm_blk_var1.c. (#707)
    
    Details:
    - Factored some of the structure awareness out of the loop in
      bli_packm_blk_var1(). So instead of having a single loop with
      conditionals in the body to handle various kinds of structure (and
      stored/unstored submatrix placement), we now have a conditional branch
      to handle various structure/storage scenarios with a loop in each
      section. This change was originally motivated to choose slab or round-
      robin partitioning (in the context of triangular matrices) based on
      the structure of the entire block (or panel) being packed rather than
      each micropanel individually. Previously, the code would attempt to
      limit rr to the portion of the block that intersects the diagonal and
      use slab for the remainder. However, that approach was not well-thought
      out and in many situations this would lead to inferior load balancing
      when compared to using round-robin for the entire block (or panel).
      This commit has the added benefit of incurring less overhead during
      the packing process now that each of the new loops is simpler.

    Switch to l3 sup decorator in gemmlike sandbox. (#704)
    
    Details:
    - Modified the gemmlike sandbox to call bli_l3_sup_thread_decorator()
      rather than a local analogue of that code. This reduces redundant
      logic and makes it easier for the sandbox to inherit future
      improvements to the framework's threading code.
    - Moved addon/gemmd to addon/old/gemmd. This code has fallen out of date
      and is taking too much effort to maintain. We will very likely
      reimplement it completely once future changes are made to the
      framework proper.

    Applied race condition fix to sup thread decorator.
    
    Details:
    - Applied the race condition bugfix in commit 7d23dc2 to the
      corresponding sup code in bli_l3_sup_decor.c. Note that in the case
      of sup, the race condition would have only manifested when optional
      packing was enabled at runtime (typically via setting BLIS_PACK_A
      and/or BLIS_PACK_B environment variables).
    - Both the fix in this commit and the fix in 7d23dc2 address bugs
      that were introduced when the thrinfo_t trees/communicators were
      restructured in the October omnibus commit (aeb5f0c).

    Fix a race condition which manifested as incorrect results (rarely). (#702)
    
    The problem occurs when there are at least two teams of threads packing different parts of a matrix, and where each team has at least two threads; call them team A and team B. The problematic sequence is:
    
    1. The chief of team A checks out a block B and broadcasts the pointer to its teammates.
    2. Team A completely packs their data and perform a barrier amongst themselves.
    3. Team A commences computing with the packed data.
    4. The chief of team A finishes computing before its teammates, then calls bli_thrinfo_free on its thrinfo_t struct (which contains the mem_t object referencing the buffer B). This causes buffer B to be checked back in to the pba.
    5. The chief of team B checks out the *same* block B that was just checked back in and broadcasts the pointer to its teammates.
    6. DATA RACE: now the remaining threads of team A are reading *while* team B are writing to the same buffer B. If team A write new data before team B are done computing then an incorrect result is generated.
    
    The solution is to place a global barrier before the call to bli_thrinfo_free at the end of the computation.

    Skip 1m optimization when forcing hemm_l/symm_l. (#697)
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in right-sided hemm when:
      - using the 1m method,
      - #defining BLIS_DISABLE_HEMM_RIGHT in the active subconfiguration,
        and
      - the storage of C matches the gemm microkernel IO preference PRIOR to
        the right-sidedness being detected and recast in terms of the left-
        side code path.
      It turns out that bli_gemm_ind_recast_1m_params() was applying its
      optimization (recasting a complex-domain macrokernel calling a 1m
      virtual microkernel to a real-domain macrokernel calling the real-
      domain microkernel) in situations in which it should not have. The
      optimization was silently assuming that the storage of C always
      matched that of the microkernel preference, since the front-end (in
      this case, bli_hemm_front()) would have already had a chance to
      transpose the operation to bring the two into agreement. However, by
      disabling right-sided hemm, we deprive BLIS of that flexibility (as a
      transposed left-sided case would necessarily have to become a right-
      sided case), and thus the assumption was no longer holding in all
      cases. Thanks to Nisanth M P for reporting this bug in Issue #621.
    - The aforementioned bug, and its bugfix, also apply to symm when
      BLIS_DISABLE_SYMM_RIGHT is defined.
    - Comment updates.
    - CREDITS file update.

    Fixed perf of mt sup with packing, and mt gemmlike. (#696)
    
    Details:
    - Brought the gemmsup code path up to date relative to the latest
      thrinfo_t semantics introduced in the October Omnibus commit
      (aeb5f0c). This was done by passing the prenode (instead of the
      current node) into the packm variant within bli_l3_sup_packm.c as well
      as creating the prenodes and attaching them to the thrinfo_t tree in
      bli_l3_sup_thrinfo_create(). These changes erase the performance
      degradation introduced in the omnibus when running multithreaded sup
      with optional packing enabled. Special thanks to Devin Matthews for
      sussing out this fix in short order.
    - Fixed the gemmlike sandbox in a manner similar to that of sup with
      packing, described above. This also involved passing the prenode into
      the local gemmlike packm variant. (Recall that gemmlike recycles the
      use of bli_l3_sup_thrinfo_create(), so it automatically inherits that
      part of the sup fix described above.)
    - Updated bls_l3_packm_var[123].c to use bli_thrinfo_n_way() and
      bli_thrinfo_work_id() instead of bli_thrinfo_num_threads() and
      bli_thrinfo_thread_id(), respectively.

    Fixed _gemm_small() prototype; disabled gemm_small.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a mismatch between the prototype for bli_gemm_small() in
      bli_gemm_front.h and the actual definition of bli_gemm_small() in
      kernels/zen/3/bli_gemm_small.c. The former was erroneously declaring
      the cntl_t* argument as 'const'. Thanks to Jeff Diamond for reporting
      this issue.
    - Commented out BLIS_ENABLE_SMALL_MATRIX, BLIS_ENABLE_SMALL_MATRIX_TRSM
      macro definitions in config/zen3/bli_family_zen3.h. AMD's small matrix
      implementation should probably remain disabled in vanilla BLIS, at
      least for now.

    blis support for hpx (#682)
    
    Implement threading backend via HPX.
    
    HPX is an asynchronous many task runtime system used in high performance computing applications. The runtime implements the ISO C++ parallelism specification and provides a user-space thread implementation.
    
    This PR provides BLIS a thread backend implementation using HPX and resolves feature request #681. The configuration script, makefiles, and testsuite have been updated to support an HPX build option. The addition of HPX support provides other developers an exemplar for integrating other C++ threading backends into BLIS.

    Fixed subtle barrier_fpa bug in bli_thrcomm.c. (#690)
    
    Details:
    - In bli_thrcommo.c, correctly initialize the BLIS_OPENMP element of the
      barrier function pointer array (barrier_fpa) to NULL when
      BLIS_ENABLE_OPENMP is *not* defined. Similarly, initialize the
      BLIS_POSIX element of barrier_fpa to NULL when BLIS_ENABLE_PTHREADS is
      not enabled. This bug was introduced in a1a5a9b and was likely the
      result of an incomplete edit. The effects of the bug would have
      likely manifested when querying a thrcomm_t that was initialized with
      a timpl_t value corresponding to a threading implementation that was
      omitted from the -t option at configure-time.

    Fixed trmm[3]/trsm performance bug in cf7d616. (#685)
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a performance bug in the packing of micropanels that intersect
      the diagonal of triangular matrices (i.e., those found in trmm, trmm3,
      and trsm). This bug was introduced in cf7d616 and stemmed from an
      ill-formed boolean conditional expression in bli_packm_blk_var1().
      This conditional would chose when to use round-robin parallel work
      allocation, but checked for the triangularity of the submatrix being
      packed while failing also to check for whether the current micropanel
      actually intersected the diagonal. The net result of this bug was that
      *all* micropanels of a triangular matrix, no matter where the upanels
      resided within the matrix, were assigned to threads via a round-robin
      policy. This affected some microarchitectures and threading
      configurations much worse than others, but it seems that overall the
      effect was universally negative, likely because of the reduced spatial
      locality during the packing with round-robin. Thanks to Leick Robinson
      for his tireless efforts in helping track down this issue.

    Fixed performance bug caused by redundant packing. (#680)
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a performance bug whereby multiple threads were redundantly
      packing the same (rather than separate) micropanels. This bug was
      caused by different parts of the code using the num_threads/thread_id
      field of the thrinfo_t vs. the n_way/work_id fields. The fix was to
      standardize on the latter and provide a "fake" thrinfo_t sub-prenode
      in the thrinfo tree which consists of single-member thread teams. The
      single team with multiple threads node is still required since it and
      only it can be used to perform barriers and broadcasts (e.g. of the
      packed buffer pointer).

    Omnibus PR - Oct 2023 (#678)
    
    Details:
    - This is an "omnibus" commit, consisting of multiple medium-sized
      commits that affect non-trivial aspects of BLIS. The major highlights:
      - Relocated the pba, sba pool (from the rntm_t), and mem_t (from the
        cntl_t) to the thrinfo_t object. This allows the rntm_t to be
        effectively const (although it is sometimes copied internally and
        modified to reflect different ways of parallelism). Moving the mem_t
        sets the stage for sharing a global control tree amongst all
        threads.
      - De-templatized the macrokernels for gemmt, trmm, and trsm to match
        the macrokernel for gemm, which has been de-templatized since
        54fa28b.
      - Reimplemented bli_l3_determine_kc() by separating out the logic for
        adjusting KC based on MR/NR for triangular A and/or B into a new
        function, bli_l3_adjust_kc(). For now, this function is still called
        from bli_l3_determine_kc(), but in the future we plan to have it
        called once when constructing the control tree.
      - Refactored the level-3 thread decorator into two parts:
        - One part deals only with launching threads, each one calling a
          generic thread entry function. This code resides in frame/thread
          and constitutes the definition of bli_thread_launch(). Note that
          it is specific to the threading implementation (OpenMP, pthreads,
          single, etc.)
        - The other part deals with passing the matrix operands and related
          information into bli_thread_launch(). This is the "l3 decorator"
          and now resides in frame/3. It is agnostic to the threading
          implementation.
      - Modified the "level" of the thread control tree passed in at each
        operation. Previously, each operation (e.g. bli_gemm_blk_var1()) was
        passed in a communicator representing the active thread teams which
        would share the available work. Now, the *parent* thread comm is
        passed in. The operation then grabs the child comm and uses it to
        partition the work. The difference is in bli_trsm_blk_var1(), where
        there are now two children nodes for this single operation (i.e. the
        thread control tree is split one level above where the control tree
        is). The sub-prenode is used for the trsm subproblem while the
        normal sub-node is used for the gemm part. Importantly, the parent
        comm is used for the barrier between them.
    - Removed cntl_t* arguments from bli_*_front() functions. These will be
      added back in the future when the control tree's creation is moved so
      that it happens much sooner (provided that bli_*_front() have not been
      absorbed into their respective bli_*_ex() functions).
    - Renamed various bli_thread_*() query functions to bli_thrinfo_*(),
      for consistency. This includes _num_threads(), _thread_id(), _n_way(),
      _work_id(), _sba_pool(), _pba(), _mem(), _barrier(), _broadcast(), and
      _am_chief().
    - Removed extraneous barrier from _blk_var3() of gemm and trsm.
    - Fixed a typo in bli_type_defs.h where BLIS_BLAS_INT_TYPE_SIZE was
      misspelled.

    Reinstate sanity check in bli_pool_finalize. (#671)
    
    Details:
    - Added a reinit argument to bli_pool_finalize(). This bool will signal
      whether or not the function is being called from bli_pool_reinit(). If
      it is not being called from _reinit(), we can safely check to confirm
      that .top_index == 0 (i.e., all blocks have been checked in). But if
      it *is* being called from _reinit(), then that check will be skipped
      since one of the predicted use cases for bli_pool_reinit() anticipates
      that some blocks are (probably) checked out when the pool_t is
      reinitialized.
    - Updated existing invocations of bli_pool_finalize() to pass in either
      FALSE (from bli_apool_free_block() or bli_pba_finalize_pools()) or
      TRUE (from bli_pool_reinit()) for the new reinit argument.

      bli_pool_checkin_block(). This detects "double-free" and other bad
      conditions that don't necessarily result in a segfault.
    - Make sure to copy all block pointers when growing the pool size.
      Previously, checked-out block pointers (which are guaranteed to be set
      to NULL) were not being copied, leading to the presence of
      uninitialized data.

    Add AddressSanitizer (-fsanitize=address) option. (#669)
    
    Details:
    - Added support for AddressSanitizer (ASan), a compiler-integrated
      memory error detector. The option (disabled by default) enables
      compiling and linking with the -fsanitize=address flag supported by
      clang, gcc, and probably others. This flag is employed during
      compilation of all BLIS source files *except* for optimized kernels,
      which are exempted because ASan usually requires an extra register,
      which violates the constraints for many gemm microkernels.
    - Minor whitespace, comment, ordering, and configure help text updates.

    Add consistent NaN/Inf handling in sumsqv. (#668)
    
    Details:
    - Changed sumsqv implementation as follows:
      - If there is a NaN (either real or imaginary), then return a sum of
        NaN and unit scale.
      - Else, if there is an Inf (either real or imaginary), then return a
        sum of +Inf and unit scale.
      - Otherwise behave as normal.

    Parameterized test/3 drivers via command line args. (#667)
    
    Details:
    - Rewrote the drivers in test/3, the Makefile, and the runme.sh script
      so that most of the important parameters, including parameter combo,
      datatype, storage combo, induced method, problem size range, dimension
      bindings, number of repeats, and alpha/beta values can be passed in
      via command line arguments. (Previously, most of these parameters were
      hard-coded into the driver source, except a few that were hard-coded
      into the Makefile.) If no argument is given for any particular option,
      it will be assigned a sane default. Either way, the values employed at
      runtime will be printed to stdout before the performance data in a
      section that is commented out with '%' characters (which is used by
      matlab and octave for comments), unless the -q option is given, in
      which case the driver will proceed quietly and output only performance
      data. Each driver also provides extensive help via the -h option, with
      the help text tailored for the operation in question (e.g. gemm, hemm,
      herk, etc.). In this help text, the driver reminds the user which
      implementation it was linked to (e.g. blis, openblas, vendor, eigen).
      Thanks to Jeff Diamond for suggesting this CLI-based reimagining of
      the test/3 drivers.
    - In the test/3 drivers: converted cpp macro string constants, as well
      as two string literals (for the opname and pc_str) used in each test
      driver, to global (or static) const char* strings, and replaced the
      use of strncpy() for storing the results of the command line argument
      parsing with pointer copies from the corresponding strings in argv.
      This works because the argv array is guaranteed by the C99 standard
      to persist throughout the life of the program. This new approach uses
      less storage and executes faster. Thanks to Minh Quan Ho for
      recommending this change.
    - Renamed the IMP_STR cpp macro that gets defined on the command line,
      via the test/3/Makefile, to IMPL_STR.
    - Updated runme.sh to set the problem size ranges for single-threaded
      and multithreaded execution independently from one another, as well as
      on a per-system basis.
    - Added a 'quiet' variable to runme.sh that can easily toggle quiet mode
      for the test drivers' output.
    - Very minor typecast fix in call to bli_getopt() in bli_utils.c.
    - In bli_getopt(), changed the nextchar variable from being a local
      static variable to a field of the getopt_t state struct. (Not sure why
      it was ever declared static to begin with.)
    - Other minor changes to bli_getopt() to accommodate the rewritten test
      drivers' command line parsing needs.

    Refactored some rntm_t management code. (#666)
    
    Details:
    - Separated the "sanitizing" code from the auto-factorization code
      in bli_rntm_set_ways_from_rntm() and _rntm_set_ways_from_rntm_sup().
      The santizing code now resides in bli_rntm_sanitize() while the
      factorization code resides in bli_rntm_factorize() and
      bli_rntm_factorize_sup(). (There are two different functions because
      the conventional and sup factorization codes are currently somewhat
      different.) Also note that the factorization code now relies on the
      .auto_factor field to have already been set, either during
      rntm_t initialization or when the rntm_t was previously updated and
      santized. So rather than locally determining whether to auto-
      factorize, those functions just read the .auto_factor field and
      proceed accordingly.
    - Refactored and removed most code from bli_thread_init_rntm_from_env().
      This function now reads the environment variables needed to set nt,
      jc, pc, ic, jr, and ir; sets them into the global rntm_t; and then
      calls bli_rntm_sanitize() in order to make sure that the contents are
      in a "good" state. Thanks to Devin Matthews for suggesting this
      refactoring.
    - Redefined bli_rntm_set_num_threads() and bli_rntm_set_ways() such that
      if multithreading is disabled at compile time (that is, if the cpp
      macro BLIS_ENABLE_MULTITHREADING is undefined), they ignore the
      caller's request and instead clear the nt and ways fields.
    - Redefined bli_thread_set_num_threads() and bli_thread_set_ways() such
      that if multithreading is disabled at compile time (that is, if the
      cpp macro BLIS_ENABLE_MULTITHREADING is undefined), they ignore the
      caller's request and do nothing.
    - Redefined bli_rntm_set_num_threads() and bli_rntm_set_ways() as true
      functions rather than static inline functions.
    - In bli_rntm.c, statically initialize the global_rntm global variable
      via the BLIS_RNTM_INITIALIZER macro.
    - In bli_rntm.h, defined bli_rntm_clear_auto_factor(), which sets the
      .auto_factor field of the rntm_t to FALSE.
    - Reorganized order of some inline function definitions in bli_rntm.h.
    - Changed the default value given to the .auto_factor field by the
      BLIS_RNTM_INITIALIZER macro from TRUE to FALSE.
    - Call bli_rntm_clear_auto_factor() instead of
      bli_rntm_set_auto_factor_only() in bli_rntm_init().
    - Comment/whitespace updates.

    Implemented support for fat multithreading. (#665)
    
    Details:
    - Allow the user to configure BLIS in such a way that multiple threading
      implementations get compiled into the library, with one of those
      implementations chosen at runtime. For now, there are only three
      implementations available: OpenMP, pthreads, and single. (Here,
      'single' merely refers to single-threaded mode.) The configure script
      now allows the user to give the -t option with a comma-separated list
      of values, such as '-t openmp,pthreads'. The first value in the list
      will always be the default at library initialization time, and
      'single' is always silently appended to the end of the list. The user
      can specify which implementation should execute in one of three ways:
      by setting the BLIS_THREAD_IMPL environment variable prior to launch;
      by calling the bli_thread_set_thread_impl() global runtime API; or by
      encoding their choice into a rntm_t that is passed into one of the
      expert interfaces. Any of these three choices overrides the
      initialization-time default (i.e., the first value listed to the -t
      configure option). Requesting an implementation that was not compiled
      into the library will result in an error message followed by
      bli_abort().
    - Relocated the 'auto' logic for the -t option from the top-level
      Makefile to the configure script. (Currently, this logic is pretty
      dumb, choosing 'openmp' for gcc and icc, and 'pthreads' for clang.)
    - Defined a new 'timpl_t' enum in bli_type_defs.h, with three valid
      values: BLIS_SINGLE, BLIS_OPENMP, BLIS_POSIX.
    - Reorganized the thrcomm_t struct into a single defintion with two
      preprocessor blocks, one each for additional fields needed by OpenMP
      and pthreads.
    - Added timpl_t argument to bli_thrcomm_bcast(), bli_thrcomm_barrier(),
      bli_thrcomm_init(), and bli_thrcomm_cleanup(), which these functions
      need since they are now wrappers that choose the implementation-
      specific function corresponding to the currently enabled threading
      implementation.
    - Added rntm_t* to bli_thread_broadcast(), bli_thread_barrier() so that
      those functions can pass the timpl_t value into bli_thrcomm_bcast()
      and bli_thrcomm_barrier(), respectively.
    - Defined bli_env_get_str() in bli_env.c to allow the querying of
      BLIS_THREAD_IMPL (which, unlike BLIS_NUM_THREADS and friends, is
      expected to be a string).
    - Defined bli_thread_get_thread_impl(), bli_thread_set_thread_impl() to
      get and set the current threading implementation at runtime.
    - Defined bli_rntm_thread_impl() and bli_rntm_set_thread_impl() to query
      and set the threading implementation within a rntm_t. Also choose
      BLIS_SINGLE as the default value when initializing rntm_t structs.
    - Added bli_info_get_*() functions to query whether OpenMP or pthreads
      would be chosen as the default at init-time. Note that this only
      tests whether OpenMP or pthreads is the first implementation in the
      list passed to the threading configure option (-t) and is *not* the
      same as querying which implementation is currently selected, since
      that can be influenced by BLIS_THREAD_IMPL and/or
      bli_thread_set_thread_impl().
    - Changed l3int_t to l3int_ft.
    - Updated docs/Multithreading.md to document the new behavior.
    - Updated sandbox/gemmlike and addon/gemmd to work with the new fat
      threading feature. This included a few bugfixes to bring the codes up
      to date, as necessary.
    - Comment, whitespace updates.

    De-templatized _sup_var1n2m.c; unified _sup_packm_a/b(). (#659)
    
    Details:
    - Re-expressed the two variants in frame/3/bli_l3_sup_var1n2m.c as a
      single function each that performs char* pointer arithmetic rather
      than four datatype-specific functions. Did the same for the functions
      in bli_l3_sup_packm_a.c and _sup_packm_b.c, and then unified the two
      into a single set of functions for packing either A or B, which now
      resides in bli_l3_sup_packm.c.
    - Pre-grow the cntl_t tree in both bli_l3_sup_var1n2m.c variants rather
      than grow them incrementally.
    - Relocated empty-matrix and scale-by-beta early return handlnig from
      bli_gemm_front() and bli_gemmt_front() to their _ex() counterparts.
    - Comment, whitespace updates.

    Fixed a harmless pc_nt bug in 05a811e.
    
    Details:
    - Added missing curly braces around some statements in bli_rntm.c, one
      of which  needed them in order for the relevant code to be executed in
      the intended way. The consequence of 05a811e omitting those braces was
      that a statement (pc_nt = 1;) was executed more often than it needed
      to be.
    - Also adjusted the analagous code in bli_thread.c to match that of
      bli_rntm.c.

      target, and building to a static library). Thanks to Jeff Diamond
      for pointing out that this test would be useful.

    Fixed gemmlike sandbox bug introduced in 7c07b47.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in the 'gemmlike' sandbox that was introduced in 7c07b47.
      This bug was the result of the fact that the gemmlike implementation
      uses bli_thrinfo_sup_grow() to grow its thrinfo_t tree, but the
      aforementioned commit added an optimization that kicks in when the
      rntm_t .pack_a and .pack_b fields are both FALSE. Those fields were
      originally added only for sup execution; for large code path, they
      are intended to be ignored. But the default initial state of a rntm_t
      has those fields set to FALSE, which was inadvertantly activating the
      optimization (which targeted single-threaded cases only) and would
      cause multithreaded use cases of 'gemmlike' to segfault. The fix took
      the form of setting the .pack_a and .pack_b fields to TRUE in
      bls_gemm_ex().
    - Added minimal 'const' and 'const'-casting to 'gemmlike' so that gcc
      stays quiet.

    Initialize rntm_t nt/ways fields with 1 (not -1). (#663)
    
    Details:
    - Changed the way that rntm_t structs are initialized, mainly so that
      the global rntm_t that is set via environment variables at runtime
      may be queried by the application prior to any computation taking
      place. (Strictly speaking, the application may already query these
      fields, but they do not always contain valid values and often contain
      -1 when they are unset.) These changes also served to clarify how
      these parameters are treated, and homogenized the implementations of
      bli_rntm_set_ways_from_rntm(), bli_rntm_set_ways_from_rntm_sup(), and
      bli_thread_init_rntm_from_env(). Special thanks to Jeff Diamond,
      Leick Robinson, and Devin Matthews for pointing out that the previous
      behavior was needlessly confusing and could be improved.
    - The aforementioned modifications also included subtle changes as to
      what counts as "setting" a loop's ways of parallelism for the purposes
      of deciding whether to use the ways or the total number of threads.
      Previously, setting any loop's ways, even to 1, counted in favor of
      using the ways. Now, only values greater than 1 will count as
      "setting", and all other values will silently be mapped to 1, with
      those parameters treated as if they were untouched all along.
    - Updated bli_rntm.h and bli_thread.c so that any attempt to set the
      PC_NT variable (or pc_nt field of a rntm_t) will either ignore the
      request or reassert the value as 1.
    - Updated bli_rntm_set_ways() so that rather than clear the
      num_threads field, it is set to the product of all of the per-loop
      ways of parallelism.
    - Removed code from test_libblis.c that handled the possibility of unset
      environment variables when printing out their values.
    - Removed bli_rntm_equals() inline function from bli_rntm.h, which has
      long been disabled.
    - Updates to docs/Multithreading.md related to the aforementioned
      changes.
    - Comment updates.

    Use kernel CFLAGS for 'kernels' subdirs in addons. (#658)
    
    Details:
    - Updated Makefile and common.mk so that the targeted configuration's
      kernel CFLAGS are applied to source files that are found in a
      'kernels' subdirectory within an enabled addon. For now, this
      behavior only applies when the 'kernels' directory is at the top
      level of the addon directory structure. For example, if there is an
      addon named 'foobar', the source code must be located in
      addon/foobar/kernels/ in order for it to be compiled with the target
      configurations's kernel CFLAGS. Any other source code within
      addon/foobar/ will be compiled with general-purpose CFLAGS (the same
      ones that were used on all addon code prior to this commit). Thanks
      to AMD (esp. Mithun Mohan) for suggesting this change and catching an
      intermediate bug in the PR.
    - Comment/whitespace updates.

    Fixed incorrect sizeof(type) in edge case macros. (#662)
    
    Details:
    - In bli_edge_case_macro_defs.h, the GEMM_UKR_SETUP_CT_PRE() and
      GEMMTRSM_UKR_SETUP_CT_PRE() macros previously declared their temporary
      ct microtiles as:
    
        PASTEMAC(ch,ctype)
              _ct[ BLIS_STACK_BUF_MAX_SIZE / sizeof( PASTEMAC(ch,type) ) ] \
                   __attribute__((aligned(alignment))); \
    
      The problem here is that sizeof( PASTEMAC(ch,type) ) evaluates to
      things like sizeof( BLIS_DOUBLE ), not sizeof( double ), and since
      BLIS_DOUBLE is an enum, it is typically an int, which means the
      sizeof() expression is evaluating to the wrong value. This was likely
      a benign bug, though, since BLIS does not support any computational
      datatypes that are smaller than sizeof( int ), which means the ct
      array would be *over*-allocated rather than underallocated. Thanks
      to @moon-chilled for identifying and reporting this bug in #624.

    Fix line number issue in flattened blis.h. (#660)
    
    Details:
    - Updated the top-level Makefile so that it invokes flatten-headers.py
      without the -c option, which was requesting that comments be stripped
      (since comment stripping is disabled by default).
    - Updated flatten-headers.py to accept a new option (-l) to enable
      insertion of #line directives into the output file. This new option
      is enabled by default.
    - Also added logic to flatten-headers.py that outputs a warning if both
      comment stripping and line numbers are requested since the comment
      stripping will cause the line numbers to become inaccurate.

    - Updated BLISObjectAPI.md and BLISTypedAPI.md API documentation to

    - Renamed 'beta' to 'alpha' in scalv and scalm testsuite modules (and
      input.operations files) so that the parameter name matches the

      option suppresses most informational output that would normally
      clutter up the screen. By default, verbose mode (the previous
      status quo) will be operative, and so quiet mode must be requested.

    Arm64 dgemmsup with extended MR&NR (#655)
    
    Details:
    - Since the number of registers in NEON is large but their lengths are
      short, I'm here extending both MR and NR.
    - The approach is to represent the C microtile in registers optionally
      in columns, so for sizes like 6x7m, the 'crr' kernel is the default
      with 'rrr' supported through an in-register transpose.
    - A few asm kernels are crafted for 'rv' to complete this extended size
      support.
    - For 'rd' I'm still relying heavily on C99 intrinsic kernels with
      branching so the performance might not be optimal. (Sorry for that.)
    - So far, these changes only affect the 'firestorm' subconfig.
    - This commit also contains row-preferential s12x8 and d6x8 gemm
      ukernels. These microkernels are templatized versions of the existing
      s8x12 and d6x8 ukernels defined in bli_gemm_armv8a_asm_d6x8.c.

    Temporarily disabled #line directives from 6826c1c.
    
    Details:
    - Commented out the inclusion of #line preprocessor directives in the
      flattened header output provided by build/flatten-headers.py. This
      output was added recently in 6826c1c, but was later found to have
      thrown off the line numbering referenced by compiler warnings and

      from source headers as they are inlined into the monolithic header).

    Updated ARMv8a kernels to fix 2 prefetching issues. (#649)
    
    Details:
    - The ARMv8a dgemm/sgemm microkernels had 2 prefetching issues that
      impacted performance on modern ARM platforms. The most significant
      issue was that only a single prefetch per C tile column was issued.
      When a column of C was not cache aligned, the second cache line would
      not be prefetched at all, forcing the kernel to wait for an entire
      load to update elements of C. This happened with roughly 50% of the
      C prefetches. The fix was to have two prefetches per column, spaced
      64 bytes (1 cache line) apart.
    - A secondary performance issue was that all the C prefetch instructions
      were issued sequentially at the beginning of the kernel call. This
      caused a noticeable performance slowdown. Interleaving the prefetch
      calls every 2-3 instructions in the prologue code solved the issue.

    Very minor variable updates to common.mk.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a harmless bug that would have allowed C++ headers into the list
      of header suffices specifically reserved for C99 headers. In practice,
      this would have had no substantive effect on anything since the core
      BLIS framework does not use C++ headers.

    Removed buggy cruft from power10 subconfig.
    
    Details:
    - Removed #defines for BLIS_BBN_s and BLIS_BBN_d from
      bli_kernel_defs_power10.h. These were inadvertently set in ae10d949
      because the power10 subconfig was registering bb packm ukernels, but
      only for 6xk (power10 uses s8x16 and d8x8 ukernels) and only because
      the original author (probably) copy-pasted from power9 when getting
      started. That 6xk packm registration was effectively "dead code"
      prior to ae10d949, but was then mistaken as not-dead code during the
      ae10d949 refactor. These improper bb factors may have been causing
      bugs in power10 builds. Thanks to Nicholai Tukanov for helping remind
      me what the power10 subconfig was supposed to look like.
    - Removed extraneous microkernel preference registrations from power10
      subconfig. Preferences for single and double complex gemm were being
      registered despite there being no complex gemm ukernels registered to
      go with them. Similarly, there were trsm preferences registered
      without any trsm ukernels registered (and BLIS doesn't actually use a
      preference for the trsm ukernel anyway). These extraneous
      registrations were almost surely not hurting anything, even if they
      were quite misleading.

    Add `#line` directives to flattened `blis.h`. (#643)
    
    Details:
    - Modified flatten-headers.py so that #line directives are inserted into
      the flattened blis.h file. This facilitates easier debugging when
      something is amiss in the flattened blis.h because the compiler will
      be able to refer to the line number within the original constituent
      header file (which is where the fix would go) rather than the line
      number within the flattened header (which is not as helpful).

    Fixed out-of-bounds read in haswell gemmsup kernels.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed memory access bugs in the bli_sgemmsup_rv_haswell_asm_Mx2()
      kernels, where M = {1,2,3,4,5,6}. The bugs were caused by loading four
      single-precision elements of C, via instructions such as:
    
            vfmadd231ps(mem(rcx, 0*32), xmm3, xmm4)
    
      in situations where only two elements are guaranteed to exist. (These
      bugs may not have manifested in earlier tests due to the leading
      dimension alignment that BLIS employs by default.) The issue was fixed
      by replacing lines like the one above with:
    
            vmovsd(mem(rcx), xmm0)
            vfmadd231ps(xmm0, xmm3, xmm4)
    
      Thus, we use vmovsd to explicitly load only two elements of C into
      registers, and then operate on those values using register addressing.
      Thanks to Daniël de Kok for reporting these bugs in #635, and to
      Bhaskar Nallani for proposing the fix).

    Allow uniform max problem sizes in test/3/runme.sh.
    
    Details:
    - Tweaked test/3/runme.sh so that the test driver binaries for single-
      threaded (st), single-socket (1s), and dual-socket (2s) execution can
      be built using identical problem size ranges. Previously, this was not
      possible because runme.sh used the maximum problem size, which was
      embedded into the binary filename, to tell the three classes of
      binaries apart from one another. Now, runme.sh uses the binary suffix
      ("st", "1s", or "2s") to tell them apart. This required only a few
      changes to the logic, but it also required a change in format to the
      threading config strings themselves (replacing the max problem size
      with "st", "1s", or "2s"). Thanks to Jeff Diamond for inspiring this
      improvement.

    Use BLIS_ENABLE_COMPLEX_RETURN_INTEL in blastest files (#636)
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a crash that occurs when either cblat1 or zblat1 are linked
      with a build of BLIS that was compiled with '--complex-return=intel'.
      This fix involved inserting preprocessor macro guards based on
      BLIS_ENABLE_COMPLEX_RETURN_INTEL into blastest/src/cblat1.c and
      blastest/src/zblat1.c to correctly handle situations where BLIS is
      compiled with Intel/f2c-style calling conventions for complex numbers.
    - Updated blastest/src/fortran/run-f2c.sh so that future executions
      will insert the aforementioned cpp macro conditional where
      appropriate.

    Details:

    Fixed type bug in bli_cntx_set_ukr_prefs().
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in bli_cntx_set_ukr_prefs() which erroneously typecast the
      num_t value read from va_args() down to a bool before being stored
      within the cntx_t. This bug was introduced on April 6th 2022, in
      ae10d94. This caused the ukernel preferences for double real and
      double complex to go unchanged while the preferences for single real
      and single complex were corrupted by the former datatypes'
      preference values. The bug manifested as degraded performance for
      subconfigurations that registered column-preferential ukernels. The
      reason is that the erroneous preferences trigger unnecessary
      transpositions in the operation, which forces the gemm ukernel to
      compute on matrices that are not stored according to its preference.
      Thanks to Devin Matthews, Jeff Diamond, and Leick Robinson for their
      extensive efforts and assistance in tracking down this issue.
    - Augmented the informational header that is output by the testsuite to
      include ukernel preferences for gemm, gemmtrsm_[lu], and trsm_[lu].

    Removed unused dt arg in bli_gks_query_ind_cntx().
    
    Details:
    - Removed the num_t datatype argument from bli_gks_query_ind_cntx().
      This argument stopped being needed by the function in commit e9da642.
      Its only use in bli_gks_query_ind_cntx() was to be passed through to
      the context initialization function for the chosen induced method,
      but even then, commit log notes from e9da642 indicate that I could not
      recall why the datatype argument was ever needed by the context init
      function to begin with.
    - Updated all invocations of bli_gks_query_ind_cntx() to omit the dt
      argument. Most of these invocations resided in various standalone test
      drivers (and the testsuite).

    Init/finalize via bli_pthread_switch_t API (#634).
    
    Details:
    - Defined and implemented a new pthread-like abstract datatype and API
      in bli_pthread.c. The new type, bli_pthread_switch_t, is similar to
      bli_pthread_once_t in some respects. The idea is that like a switch in
      your home that controls a light or ceiling fan, it can either be on or
      off. The switch starts in the off state. Moving from one state to the
      other (on to off; off to on) causes some action (i.e., a startup or
      shutdown function) to be executed. Trying to move from one state to
      the same state (on to on; off to off) is safe in that it results in
      no action. Unlike bli_pthread_once(), the API for bli_pthread_switch_t
      contains both _on() and _off() interfaces. Also, unlike the _once()
      function, the _on() and _off() functions return error codes so that
      the 'int' error code returned from the startup or shutdown functions
      may be passed back to the caller. Thanks to Devin Matthews for his
      input and feedback on this feature.
    - Replaced the previous implementation of bli_init_once() and
      bli_finalize_once() -- both of which used bli_pthread_once() -- with
      ones that rely upon bli_pthread_switch_on() and _switch_off(),
      respectively. This also required updating the return types of
      _init_apis() and _finalize_apis() to match the function pointer type
      required by bli_pthread_switch_on()/_switch_off().
    - Comment updates.

      they referenced only local symbols.

    Simplify and rewrite reference packm kernels. (#610)
    
    Details:
    - Reorganized the way kernels are stored within the cntx_t structure so
      that rather than having a function pointer for every supported size of
      unrolled packm kernel (2xk, 3xk, 4xk, etc.), we store only two packm
      kernels per datatype: one to pack MRxk micropanels and one to pack
      NRxk micropanels.
      - NOTE: The "bb" (broadcast B) reference kernels have been merged into
        the "standard" kernels (packm [including 1er and unpackm], gemm,
        trsm, gemmtrsm). This replication factor is controlled by
        BLIS_BB[MN]_[sdcz] etc. Power9/10 needs testing since only a
        replication factor of 1 has been tested. armsve also needs testing
        since the MR value isn't available as a macro.
    - Simplified the bli_cntx_*() APIs to conform to the new unified kernel
      array within the cntx_t. Updated existing bli_cntx_init_<subconfig>()
      function definitions for all subconfigurations.
    - Consolidated all kernel id types (e.g. l1vkr_t, l1mkr_t, l3ukr_t,
      etc.) into one kernel id type: ukr_t.
    - Various edits, updates, and rewrites of reference kernels pursuant to
      the aforementioned changes.
    - Define compile-time macro constants (BLIS_MR_[sdcz], BLIS_NR_[sdcz],
      and friends) in bli_kernel_macro_defs.h, but only when the macro
      BLIS_IN_REF_KERNEL is defined by the build system.
    - Loose ends:
      - Still need to update documentation, including:
        - docs/ConfigurationHowTo.md
        - docs/KernelsHowTo.md
        to reflect changes made in this commit.

    - Allow building BLIS with certain framework files (each with the '_amd'

      customized files were derived from portable versions of the same files
      (i.e., those without the '_amd' suffix). Whether the portable or AMD-
      specific files are compiled is now controlled by a new configure
      option, --[en|dis]able-amd-frame-tweaks. This option is disabled by
      default in vanilla BLIS, though AMD may choose to enable it by default
      in their fork. For now, the added AMD-specific files are:
      - bli_gemv_unf_var2_amd.c
      - bla_copy_amd.c
      - bla_gemv_amd.c
      These files reside in 'amd' subdirectories found within the directory
      housing their generic counterparts.
    - Register optimized real-domain copyv, setv, and swapv kernels in
      bli_cntx_init_zen.c.
    - Various minor updates to level-1v kernels in 'zen' kernel set.
    - Added caxpyf kernel as well as saxpyf and multiple daxpyf kernels to
      the 'zen' kernel set
    - If the problem passed to ?gemm_() in bla_gemm.c has a unit m or n dim,
      call gemv instead and return early.
    - Combined variable declarations with their initialization in various
      level-2 and level-3 BLAS compatibility files, and also inserted
      'const' qualifer in those same declaration statements.
    - Moved frame/compat/bla_gemmt.c and .h to frame/compat/extra/ .
    - Added copyv and swapv test drivers to 'test' directory.
    - Whitespace, comment changes.

    Added BLAS/CBLAS APIs for gemm3m. (#590)
    
    Details:
    - Created ?gemm3m_() and cblas_?gemm3m() APIs that (for now) simply
      invoke the 1m implementation unconditionally. (Note that these APIs
      bypass sup handling.)
    - Added BLAS prototypes for gemm3m in frame/compat/bla_gemm3m.h.
    - Added CBLAS prototypes for gemm3m in frame/compat/cblas/src/cblas.h.
    - Relocated:
        frame/compat/cblas/src/cblas_?gemmt.c
      files into
        frame/compat/cblas/src/extra/
    - Relocated frame/compat/bla_gemmt.? into frame/compat/extra/ .
    - Minor reorganization of prototypes and cpp macro directives in
      bli_blas.h, cblas.h, and cblas_f77.h.
    - Trival whitespace change to cblas_zgemm.c.

    Avoid gemmsup barriers when not packing A or B. (#622)
    
    Details:
    - Implemented a multithreaded optimization for the special (and common)
      case of employing the gemmsup code path when the user requests
      (implicitly or explicitly) that neither A nor B be packed during
      computation. This optimization takes the form of a greatly reduced
      code branch in bli_thrinfo_sup_create_for_cntl(), which avoids a
      broadcast and two barriers, and results in higher performance when
      obtaining two-way or higher parallelism within BLIS. Thanks to
      Bhaskar Nallani of AMD for proposing this change via issue #605.
    - Added an early return branch to bli_thrinfo_create_for_cntl() that
      detects and quickly handles cases where no parallelism is being
      obtained within BLIS (i.e., single-threaded execution). Note that
      this special case handling was/is already present in
      bli_thrinfo_sup_create_for_cntl().
    - CREDITS file update.

    Fixed level-3 performance bug in haswell ukernels.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a performance regression affecting nearly all level-3 operations
      that use the 'haswell' sgemm and dgemm microkernels. This regression
      was introduced in 54fa28b, caused by an ill-formed conditional
      expression in the assembly code that controls whether cache lines of C
      should be prefetched as rows or as columns. Essentially, the two
      branches were reversed, causing incomplete prefetching to occur for
      both row- and column-stored instances of matrix C. Thanks to Devin
      Matthews for his help finding and fixing this bug.

    Revamp how tools are handled/checked by configure.
    
    Details:
    - Consolidate handling of tools that are specifiable via CC, CXX, FC,
      PYTHON, AR, and RANLIB into one bash function, select_tool_w_env().
      - If the user specifies a tool via an environment variable (e.g.
        CC=gcc) and that tool does not seem valid, print an error message
        and abort configure, unless the tool is optional (e.g. CXX or FC),
        in which case a warning message is printed instead.
      - The definition of "seems valid" above amounts to:
        - responding to at least one of a basic set of command line options
          (e.g. --version, -V, -h) if the os_name is Linux (since GNU tools
          tend to respond to flags such as --version) or if the tool in
          question is CC, CXX, FC, or PYTHON (which tend to respond to the
          expected flags regardless of OS)
        - the binary merely existing for AR and RANLIB on Darwin/OSX/BSD.
          (These OSes tend to have non-GNU versions of ar and ranlib, which
          typically do not respond to --version and friends.)
    - This PR addresses #584. Thanks to Devin Matthews for suggesting some
      of the changes in this commit.

    Move edge cases to gemmtrsm ukrs; doc updates.
    
    Details:
    - Moved edge-case handling into the gemmtrsm microkernel. This required
      changing the microkernel API to take m and n dimension parameters as
      well as updating all existing gemmtrsm microkernel function pointer
      types, function signatures, and related definitions to take m and n
      dimensions. Also updated all existing gemmtrsm kernels in the
      'kernels' directory (which for now is limited to haswell and penryn
      kernel sets, plus native and 1m-based reference kernels in
      'ref_kernels') to take m and n dimensions, and implemented edge-case
      handling within those microkernels via a collection of new C
      preprocessor macros defined within bli_edge_case_macro_defs.h. Note
      that the edge-case handling for gemm-like operations had already
      been relocated into the gemm microkernel in 54fa28b.
    - Added desriptive comments to GEMM_UKR_SETUP_CT() and related macros in
      bli_edge_case_macro_defs.h to allow for easier reading.
    - Updated docs/KernelsHowTo.md to reflect above changes. Also cleaned up
      the bullet under "Implementation Notes for gemm" that covers alignment
      issues. (Thanks to Ivan Korostelev for pointing out the confusing and
      outdated language in issue #591.)
    - Other minor tweaks to KernelsHowTo.md.

    Added m, n dims to gemmd/gemmlike ukernel calls.
    
    Details:
    - Updated the gemmd addon and the gemmlike sandbox code to use the new
      microkernel calling sequence, which now includes m and n dimensions so
      that the microkernel has all the information necessary to handle edge
      cases. Thanks to Jeff Diamond for catching this, which ideally would
      have been included in commit 54fa28b.
    - Retired var2 of both gemmd and gemmlike to 'attic' directories and
      removed their corresponding prototypes. In both cases, var2 was a
      variant of the block-panel algorithm where edge-case handling was
      abstracted away to a microkernel wrapper. (Since this is now the
      official behavior of BLIS microkernels, I saw no need to have it
      included as a separate code path.)

    Move edge cases to gemm ukr; more user-custom mods. (#583)
    
    Details:
    - Moved edge-case handling into the gemm microkernel. This required
      changing the microkernel API to take m and n dimension parameters.
      This required updating all existing gemm microkernel function pointer
      types, function signatures, and related definitions to take m and n
      dimensions. We also updated all existing kernels in the 'kernels'
      directory to take m and n dimensions, and implemented edge-case
      handling within those microkernels via a collection of new C
      preprocessor macros defined within bli_edge_case_macro_defs.h. Also
      removed the assembly code that formerly would handle general stride
      IO on the microtile, since this can now be handled by the same code
      that does edge cases.
    - Pass the obj_t.ker_fn (of matrix C) into bli_gemm_cntl_create() and
      bli_trsm_cntl_create(), where this function pointer is used in lieu of
      the default macrokernel when it is non-NULL, and ignored when it is
      NULL.
    - Re-implemented macrokernel in bli_gemm_ker_var2.c to be a single
      function using byte pointers rather that one function for each
      floating-point datatype. Also, obtain the microkernel function pointer
      from the .ukr field of the params struct embedded within the obj_t
      for matrix C (assuming params is non-NULL and contains a non-NULL
      value in the .ukr field). Communicate both the gemm microkernel
      pointer to use as well as the params struct to the microkernel via
      the auxinfo_t struct.
    - Defined gemm_ker_params_t type (for the aforementioned obj_t.params
      struct) in bli_gemm_var.h.
    - Retired the separate _md macrokernel for mixed datatype computation.
      We now use the reimplemented bli_gemm_ker_var2() instead.
    - Updated gemmt macrokernels to pass m and n dimensions into microkernel
      calls.
    - Removed edge-case handling from trmm and trsm macrokernels.
    - Moved most of bli_packm_alloc() code into a new helper function,
      bli_packm_alloc_ex().
    - Fixed a typo bug in bli_gemmtrsm_u_template_noopt_mxn.c.
    - Added test/syrk_diagonal and test/tensor_contraction directories with
      associated code to test those operations.

    Enable user-customized packm ukernel/variant. (#549)
    
    Details:
    - Added four new fields to obj_t: .pack_fn, .pack_params, .ker_fn, and
      .ker_params. These fields store pointers to functions and data that
      will allow the user to more flexibly create custom operations while
      recycling BLIS's existing partitioning infrastructure.
    - Updated typed API to packm variant and structure-aware kernels to
      replace the diagonal offset with panel offsets, and changed strides
      of both C and P to inc/ldim semantics. Updated object API to the packm
      variant to include rntm_t*.
    - Removed the packm variant function pointer from the packm cntl_t node
      definition since it has been replaced by the .pack_fn pointer in the
      obj_t.
    - Updated bli_packm_int() to read the new packm variant function pointer
      from the obj_t and call it instead of from the cntl_t node.
    - Moved some of the logic of bli_l3_packm.c to a new file,
      bli_packm_alloc.c.
    - Rewrote bli_packm_blk_var1.c so that it uses byte (char*) pointers
      instead of typed pointers, allowing a single function to be used
      regardless of datatype. This obviated having a separate implementation
      in bli_packm_blk_var1_md.c. Also relegated handling of scalars to a
      new function, bli_packm_scalar().
    - Employed a new standard whereby right-hand matrix operands ("B") are
      always packed as column-stored row panels -- that is, identically to
      that of left-hand matrix operands ("A"). This means that while we pack
      matrix A normally, we actually pack B in a transposed state. This
      allowed us to simplify a lot of code throughout the framework, and
      also affected some of the logic in bli_l3_packa() and _packb().
    - Simplified bli_packm_init.c in light of the new B^T convention
      described above. bli_packm_init()--which is now called from within
      bli_packm_blk_var1()--also now calls bli_packm_alloc() and returns
      a bool that indicates whether packing should be performed (or
      skipped).
    - Consolidated bli_gemm_int() and bli_trsm_int() into a bli_l3_int(),
      which, among other things, defaults the new .pack_fn field of the
      obj_t to bli_packm_blk_var1() if the field is NULL.
    - Defined a new function, bli_obj_reset_origin(), which permanently
      refocuses the view of an object so that it "forgets" any offsets from
      its original pointer. This function also sets the object's root field
      to itself. Calls to bli_obj_reset_origin() for each matrix operand
      appear in the _front() functions, after the obj_t's are aliased. This
      resetting of the underlying matrices' origins is needed in preparation
      for more advanced features from within custom packm kernels.
    - Redefined bli_pba_rntm_set_pba() from a regular function to a static
      inline function.
    - Updated gemm_ukr, gemmtrsm_ukr, and trsm_ukr testsuite modules to use
      libblis_test_pobj_create() to create local packed objects. Previously,
      these packed objects were created by calling lower-level functions.

    Added support for AMD's Zen3 microarchitecture.
    
    Details:
    - Added a new 'zen3' subconfiguration targeting support for the AMD Zen3
      microarchitecture (#561). Thanks to AMD for this contribution.
    - Restructured clang and AOCC support for zen, zen2, and zen3
      make_defs.mk files. The clang and AOCC version detection now happens
      in configure, not in the subconfigurations' makefile fragments. That
      is, we've added logic to configure that detects the version of
      clang/AOCC, outputs an appropriate variable to config.mk
      (ie: CLANG_OT_*, AOCC_OT_*), and then checks for it within the
      makefile fragment (as is currently done for the GCC_OT_* variables).
    - Added configure support for a GCC_OT_10_1_0 variable (and associated
      substitution anchor) to communicate whether the gcc version is older
      than 10.1.0, and use this variable to check for recent enough versions
      of gcc to use -march=znver3 in the zen3 subconfig.
    - Inlined the contents of config/zen/amd_config.mk into the zen and zen2
      make_defs.mk so that the files are self-contained, harmonizing the
      format of all three Zen-based subconfigurations' make_defs.mk files.
    - Added indenting (with spaces) of GNU make conditionals for easier
      reading in zen, zen2, and zen3 make_defs.mk files.
    - Adjusted the range of models checked by bli_cpuid_is_zen() (which was
      previously 0x00 ~ 0xff and is now 0x00 ~ 0x2f) so that it is
      completely disjoint from the models checked by bli_cpuid_is_zen2()
      (0x30 ~ 0xff). This is normally necessary because Zen and Zen2
      microarchitectures share the same family (23, or 0x17), and so the
      model code is the only way to differentiate the two. But in our case,
      fixing the model range for zen *wasn't* actually necessary since we
      checked for zen2 first, and therefore the wide zen range acted like
      the 'else' of an 'if-else' statement. That said, the change helps
      improve clarity for the reader by encoding useful knowledge, which
      was obtained from https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/amd/cpuid .
    - Added zen2.def and zen3.def files to the collection in travis/cpuid.
      Note that support for zen, zen2, and zen3 is now present, and while
      all the three microarchitectures have identical instruction sets from
      the perspective of BLIS microkernels, they each correspond to
      different subconfigurations and therefore merit separate testing.
      Thanks to Devin Matthews for his guidance in hacking these files as
      slight modifications of zen.def.
    - Enabled testing of zen2 and zen3 via the SDE in travis/do_sde.sh.
      Now, zen, zen2, and zen3 are tested through the SDE via Travis CI
      builds.
    - Updated travis/do_sde.sh to grab the SDE tarball from a new ci-utils
      repository on GitHub rather than on Intel's website. This change was
      made in an attempt to circumvent recent troubles with Travis CI not
      being able to download the SDE directly from Intel's website via curl.
      Thanks to Devin Matthews for suggesting the idea.
    - Updated travis/do_sde.sh to grab the latest version (8.69.1) of the
      Intel SDE from the flame/ci-utils repository.
    - Updated .travis.yml to use gcc 9. The file was previously using gcc 8,
      which did not support -march=znver2.
    - Created amd64_legacy umbrella family in config_registry for targeting
      older (bulldozer, piledriver, steamroller, and excavator)
      microarchitectures and moved those same subconfigs out of the amd64
      umbrella family. However, x86_64 retains amd64_legacy as a constituent
      member.
    - Fixed a bug in configure related to the building of the so-called
      config list. When processing the contents of config_registry,
      configure creates a series of structures and lists that allow for
      various mappings related to configuration families, subconfigs, and
      kernel sets. Two of those lists are built via substitution of
      umbrella families with their subconfig members, and one of those
      lists was improperly performing the substitution in a way that would
      erroneously match on partial umbrella family names. That code was
      changed to match the code that was already doing the substitution
      properly, via substitute_words(). Also added comments noting the
      importance of using substitute_words() in both instances.
    - Comment updates.

    Added support for addons.
    
    Details:
    - Implemented a new feature called addons, which are similar to
      sandboxes except that there is no requirement to define gemm or any
      other particular operation.
    - Updated configure to accept --enable-addon=<name> or -a <name> syntax
      for requesting an addon be included within a BLIS build. configure now
      outputs the list of enabled addons into config.mk. It also outputs the
      corresponding #include directives for the addons' headers to a new
      companion to the bli_config.h header file named bli_addon.h. Because
      addons may wish to make use of existing BLIS types within their own
      definitions, the addons' headers must be included sometime after that
      of bli_config.h (which currently is #included before bli_type_defs.h).
      This is why the #include directives needed to go into a new top-level
      header file rather than the existing bli_config.h file.
    - Added a markdown document, docs/Addons.md, to explain addons, how to
      build with them, and what assumptions their authors should keep in
      mind as they create them.
    - Added a gemmlike-like implementation of sandwich gemm called 'gemmd'
      as an addon in addon/gemmd. The code uses a 'bao_' prefix for local
      functions, including the user-level object and typed APIs.
    - Updated .gitignore so that git ignores bli_addon.h files.

    Added BLAS/CBLAS APIs for axpby, gemm_batch. (#566)
    
    Details:
    - Expanded the BLAS compatibility layer to include support for
      ?axpby_() and ?gemm_batch_(). The former is a straightforward
      BLAS-like interface into the axpbyv operation while the latter
      implements a batched gemm via loops over bli_?gemm(). Also
      expanded the CBLAS compatibility layer to include support for
      cblas_?axpby() and cblas_?gemm_batch(), which serve as wrappers to
      the corresponding (new) BLAS-like APIs. Thanks to Meghana Vankadari
      for submitting these new APIs via #566.
    - Fixed a long-standing bug in common.mk that for some reason never
      manifested until now. Previously, CBLAS source files were compiled
      *without* the location of cblas.h being specified via a -I flag.
      I'm not sure why this worked, but it may be due to the fact that
      the cblas.h file resided in the same directory as all of the CBLAS
      source, and perhaps compilers implicitly add a -I flag for the
      directory that corresponds to the location of the source file being
      compiled. This bug only showed up because some CBLAS-like source code
      was moved into an 'extra' subdirectory of that frame/compat/cblas/src
      directory. After moving the code, compilation for those files failed
      (because the cblas.h header file, presumably, could not be found in
      the same location). This bug was fixed within common.mk by explicitly
      adding the cblas.h directory to the list of -I flags passed to the
      compiler.
    - Added test_axpbyv.c and test_gemm_batch.c files to 'test' directory,
      and updated test/Makefile to build those drivers.
    - Fixed typo in error message string in cblas_sgemm.c.

    Refactored her[2]k/syr[2]k in terms of gemmt. (#531)
    
    Details:
    - Renamed herk macrokernels and supporting files and functions to gemmt,
      which is possible since at the macrokernel level they are identical.
      Then recast herk/her2k/syrk/syr2k in terms of gemmt within the expert
      level-3 oapi (bli_l3_oapi_ex.c) while also redefining them as literal
      functions rather than cpp macros that instantiate multiple functions.
      Thanks to Devin Matthews for his efforts on this issue (#531).
    - Check that the maximum stack buffer size is sufficiently large
      relative to the register blocksizes for each datatype, and do so when
      the context is initialized rather than when an operation is called.
      Note that with this change, users who pass in their own contexts into
      the expert interfaces currently will *not* have any checks performed.
      Thanks to Devin Matthews for suggesting this change.

    Fixed bug in mixed-dt gemm introduced in e9da642.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug that broke certain mixed-datatype gemm behavior. This
      bug was introduced recently in e9da642 when the code that performs
      the operation transposition (for microkernel IO preference purposes)
      was moved up so that it occurred sooner. However, when I moved that
      code, I failed to notice that there was a cpp-protected "if"
      conditional that applied to the entire code block that was moved. Once
      the code block was relocated, the orphaned if-statement was now
      (erroneously) glomming on to the next thing that happened to be in the
      function, which happened to be the call to bli_rntm_set_ways_for_op(),
      causing a rather odd memory exhaustion error in the sba due to the
      num_threads field of the rntm_t still being -1 (because the rntm_t
      field were never processed as they should have been). Thanks to
      @ArcadioN09 (Snehith) for reporting this error and helpfully including
      relevant memory trace output.

    Removed support for 3m, 4m induced methods.
    
    Details:
    - Removed support for all induced methods except for 1m. This included
      removing code related to 3mh, 3m1, 4mh, 4m1a, and 4m1b as well as any
      code that existed only to support those implementations. These
      implementations were rarely used and posed code maintenance challenges
      for BLIS's maintainers going forward.
    - Removed reference kernels for packm that pack 3m and 4m micropanels,
      and removed 3m/4m-related code from bli_cntx_ref.c.
    - Removed support for 3m/4m from the code in frame/ind, then reorganized
      and streamlined the remaining code in that directory. The *ind(),
      *nat(), and *1m() APIs were all removed. (These additional API layers
      no longer made as much sense with only one induced method (1m) being
      supported.) The bli_ind.c file (and header) were moved to frame/base
      and bli_l3_ind.c (and header) and bli_l3_ind_tapi.h were moved to
      frame/3.
    - Removed 3m/4m support from the code in frame/1m/packm.
    - Removed 3m/4m support from trmm/trsm macrokernels and simplified some
      pointer arithmetic that was previously expressed in terms of the
      bli_ptr_inc_by_frac() static inline function (whose definition was
      also removed).
    - Removed the following subdirectories of level-0 macro headers from
      frame/include/level0: ri3, rih, ri, ro, rpi. The level-0 scalar macros
      defined in these directories were used exclusively for 3m and 4m
      method codes.
    - Simplified bli_cntx_set_blkszs() and bli_cntx_set_ind_blkszs() in
      light of 1m being the only induced method left within BLIS.
    - Removed dt_on_output field within auxinfo_t and its associated
      accessor functions.
    - Re-indexed the 1e/1r pack schemas after removing those associated with
      variants of the 3m and 4m methods. This leaves two bits unused within
      the pack format portion of the schema bitfield. (See bli_type_defs.h
      for more info.)
    - Spun off the basic and expert interfaces to the object and typed APIs
      into separate files: bli_l3_oapi.c and bli_l3_oapi_ex.c; bli_l3_tapi.c
      and bli_l3_tapi_ex.c.
    - Moved the level-3 operation-specific _check function calls from the
      operations' _front() functions to the corresponding _ex() function of
      the object API. (This change roughly maintains where the _check()
      functions are called in the call stack but lays the groundwork for
      future changes that may come to the level-3 object APIs.) Minor
      modifications to bli_l3_check.c to allow the check() functions to be
      called from the expert interface APIs.
    - Removed support within the testsuite for testing the aforementioned
      induced methods, and updated the standalone test drivers in the 'test'
      directory so reflect the retirement of those induced methods.
    - Modified the sandbox contract so that the user is obliged to define
      bli_gemm_ex() instead of bli_gemmnat(). (This change was made in light
      of the *nat() functions no longer existing.) Also updated the existing
      'power10' and 'gemmlike' sandboxes to come into compliance with the
      new sandbox rules.
    - Updated BLISObjectAPI.md, BLISTypedAPI.md, Testsuite.md documentation
      to reflect the retirement of 3m/4m, and also modified Sandboxes.md to
      bring the document into alignment with new conventions.
    - Updated various comments; removed segments of commented-out code.

    Fixed substitution bug in configure.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in configure related to the building of the so-called
      config list. When processing the contents of config_registry,
      configure creates a series of structures and list that allow for
      various mappings related to configuration families, subconfigs,
      and kernel sets. Two of those lists are built via subsitituion
      of umbrella families with their subconfig members, and one of
      those lists was improperly performing the subtitution in a way
      that would erroneously match on partial umbrella family names.
      That code was changed to match the code that was already doing
      the subtitution properly, via substitute_words().
    - Added comments noting the importance of using substitute_words()
      in both instances.

    Allow use of 1m with mixing of row/col-pref ukrs.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug that broke the use of 1m for dcomplex when the single-
      precision real and double-precision real ukernels had opposing I/O
      preferences (row-preferential sgemm ukernel + column-preferential
      dgemm ukernel, or vice versa). The fix involved adjusting the API
      to bli_cntx_set_ind_blkszs() so that the induced method context init
      function (e.g., bli_cntx_init_<subconfig>_ind()) could call that
      function for only one datatype at a time. This allowed the blocksize
      scaling (which varies depending on whether we're doing 1m_r or 1m_c)
      to happen on a per-datatype basis. This fixes issue #557. Thanks to
      Devin Matthews and RuQing Xu for helping discover and report this bug.
    - The aforementioned 1m fix required moving the 1m_r/1m_c logic from
      bli_cntx_ref.c into a new function, bli_l3_set_schemas(), which is
      called from each level-3 _front() function. The pack_t schemas in the
      cntx_t were also removed entirely, along with the associated accessor
      functions. This in turn required updating the trsm1m-related virtual
      ukernels to read the pack schema for B from the auxinfo_t struct
      rather than the context. This also required slight tweaks to
      bli_gemm_md.c.
    - Repositioned the logic for transposing the operation to accommodate
      the microkernel IO preference. This mostly only affects gemm. Thanks
      to Devin Matthews for his help with this.
    - Updated dpackm pack ukernels in the 'armsve' kernel set to avoid
      querying pack_t schemas from the context.
    - Removed the num_t dt argument from the ind_cntx_init_ft type defined
      in bli_gks.c. The context initialization functions for induced methods
      were previously passed a dt argument, but I can no longer figure out
      *why* they were passed this value. To reduce confusion, I've removed
      the dt argument (including also from the function defintion +
      prototype).
    - Commented out setting of cntx_t schemas in bli_cntx_ind_stage.c. This
      breaks high-leve implementations of 3m and 4m, but this is okay since
      those implementations will be removed very soon.
    - Removed some older blocks of preprocessor-disabled code.

    Alloc at least 1 elem in pool_t block_ptrs. (#560)
    
    Details:
    - Previously, the block_ptrs field of the pool_t was allowed to be
      initialized as any unsigned integer, including 0. However, a length of
      0 could be problematic given that malloc(0) is undefined and therefore
      variable across implementations. As a safety measure, we check for
      block_ptrs array lengths of 0 and, in that case, increase them to 1.

    Fix insufficient pool-growing logic in bli_pool.c. (#559)
    
    Details:
    - The current mechanism for growing a pool_t doubles the length of the
      block_ptrs array every time the array length needs to be increased
      due to new blocks being added. However, that logic did not take in
      account the new total number of blocks, and the fact that the caller
      may be requesting more blocks that would fit even after doubling the
      current length of block_ptrs. The code comments now contain two
      illustrating examples that show why, even after doubling, we must
      always have at least enough room to fit all of the old blocks plus
      the newly requested blocks.
    - This commit also happens to fix a memory corruption issue that stems
      from growing any pool_t that is initialized with a block_ptrs length
      of 0. (Previously, the memory pool for packed buffers of C was
      initialized with a block_ptrs length of 0, but because it is unused
      this bug did not manifest by default.)

    Make error checking level a thread-local variable.
    
    Previously, this was a global variable. Setting the value was synchronized via a mutex but reading the value was not. Of course, these accesses are almost certainly atomic, but there is still the possibility of one thread attempting to set the value and then reading the value set by another thread. For correct operation under user threading (e.g. pthreads), this should probably be thread-local with no mutex.

    Arm micro-architecture dispatch (#344)
    
    Details:
    - Reworked support for ARM hardware detection in bli_cpuid.c to parse
      the result of a CPUID-like instruction.
    - Added a64fx support to bli_gks.c.
    - #include arm64 and arm32 family headers from bli_arch_config.h.
    - Fix the ordering of the "armsve" and "a64fx" strings in the
      config_name string array in bli_arch.c. The ordering did not match
      the ordering of the corresponding arch_t values in bli_type_defs.h,
      as it should have all along.
    - Added clang support to make_defs.mk in arm64, cortexa53, cortexa57
      subconfigs.
    - Updated arm64 and arm32 families in config_registry.
    - Updated docs/HardwareSupport.md to reflect added ARM support.
    - Thanks to Dave Love, RuQing Xu, and Devin Matthews for their
      contributions in this PR (#344).

    Use @path-based install name on MacOS and use relocatable RPATH entries for testsuite inaries.
    
    - RPATH entries (and DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH) do nothing on macOS unless the install_name of the library starts with @rpath/. While the install_name can be set to the absolute install path, this makes the installation non-relocatable. When using @path in the install_name, install paths within the normal DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH work with no changes on the user side, but for install paths off the beaten track, users must specify an RPATH entry when linking (or modify DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH at runtime). Perhaps this could be made into a configure-time option.
    - Having relocable testsuite binaries is not necessarily a priority but it is easy to do with @executable_path (macOS) or $ORIGIN (linux/BSD).

    Re-enable and fix fb93d24.
    
    Details:
    - Re-enabled the changes made in fb93d24.
    - Defined BLIS_ENABLE_SYSTEM in bli_arch.c, bli_cpuid.c, and bli_env.c,
      all of which needed the definition (in addition to config_detect.c) in
      order for the configure-time hardware detection binary to be compiled
      properly. Thanks to Minh Quan Ho for helping identify these additional
      files as needing to be updated.
    - Added additional comments to all four source files, most notably to
      prompt the reader to remember to update all of the files when updating
      any of the files. Also made the cpp code in each of the files as
      consistent/similar as possible.
    - Refer to issues #532 and PR #546 for more history.

    Re-enable and fix 8e0c425 (BLIS_ENABLE_SYSTEM).
    
    Details:
    - Re-enable the changes originally made in 8e0c425 but quickly reverted
      in 2be78fc.
    - Moved the #include of bli_config.h so that it occurs before the
      #include of bli_system.h. This allows the #define BLIS_ENABLE_SYSTEM
      or #define BLIS_DISABLE_SYSTEM in bli_config.h to be processed by the
      time it is needed in bli_system.h. This change should have been
      in the original 8e0c425, but was accidentally omitted. Thanks to Minh
      Quan Ho for catching this.
    - Add #define BLIS_ENABLE_SYSTEM to config_detect.c so that the proper
      cpp conditional branch executes in bli_system.h when compiling the
      hardware detection binary. The changes made in 8e0c425 were an attempt
      to support the definition of BLIS_OS_NONE when configuring with
      --disable-system (in issue #532).  That commit failed because, aside
      from the required but omitted header reordering (second bullet above),
      AppVeyor was unable to compile the hardware detection binary as a
      result of missing Windows headers. This commit, which builds on PR
      #546, should help fix that issue. Thanks to Minh Quan Ho for his
      assistance and patience on this matter.

    bli_error: more cleanup on the error strings array
    
    - There was redundance between the macro BLIS_MAX_NUM_ERR_MSGS (=200) and
      the enum BLIS_ERROR_CODE_MAX (-170), while they both mean the same thing:
      the maximal number of error codes/messages.
    - The previous initialization of error messages at compile time ignored that
      the 'bli_error_string' array still occupies useless memory due to 2D char[][]
      declaration. Instead, it should be just an array of pointers, pointing at
      strings in .rodata section.
    - This commit does the two modifications:
       * retired macros BLIS_MAX_NUM_ERR_MSGS and BLIS_MAX_ERR_MSG_LENGTH everywhere
       * switch bli_error_string from char[][] to char *[] to reduce its footprint
         from 40KB (200*200) to 1.3KB (170*sizeof(char*)).
         (No problem to use the enum BLIS_ERROR_CODE_MAX at compile-time,
         since compiler is smart enough to determine its value is 170.)

    Details:
    - Removed the commented-out #define BLIS_NUM_ARCHS in bli_type_defs.h
      and its associated (now outdated) comments. BLIS_NUM_ARCHS has been
      part of the arch_t enum for some time now, and so this change is
      mostly about removing any opportunity for confusion for people who
      may be reading the code. Thanks to Minh Quan Ho for leading me to
      cleanup.

    Added new packm var3 to 'gemmlike'.
    
    Details:
    - Defined a new packm variant for the 'gemmlike' sandbox. This new
      variant (bls_l3_packm_var3.c) parallelizes the packing operation over
      the k dimension rather than the m or n dimensions. Note that the
      gemmlike implementation still uses var1 by default, and use of the new
      code would require changing bls_l3_packm_a.c and/or bls_l3_packm_b.c
      so that var3 is called instead. Thanks to Jeff Diamond for proposing
      this (perhaps NUMA-friendly) solution.

      #included immediately after "bli_system.h" in blis.h. This change is
      an attempt to fix a report of recent breakage of C++ compilers due
      to the recent introduction of 'restrict' in bli_type_defs.h (which
      previously was being included *before* bli_macro_defs.h and its
      restrict handling therein. Thanks to Ivan Korostelev for reporting

    Minor tweaks to gemmlike sandbox.
    
    Details:
    - In the gemmlike sandbox, changed the loop index variable of inner
      loop of packm_cxk() from 'd' to 'i' (and likewise for the
      corresponding inlined code within packm_var2()).
    - Pack matrices A and B using packm_var1() instead of packm_var2().

    Added local _check() code to gemmlike sandbox.
    
    Details:
    - Added code to the gemmlike sandbox that handles parameter checking.
      Previously, the gemmlike implementation called bli_gemm_check(), which
      resides within the BLIS framework proper. Certain modifications that a
      user may wish to perform on the sandbox, such as adding a new matrix
      or vector operand, would have required additional checks, and so these
      changes make it easier for such a person to implement those checks for
      their custom gemm-like operation.

    Tweaks to gemmlike to facilitate 3rd party mods.
    
    Details:
    - Changed the implementation in the 'gemmlike' sandbox to more easily
      allow others to provide custom implementations of packm. These changes
      include:
      - Calling a local version of packm_cxk() that can be modified. This
        version of packm_cxk() uses inlined loops in packm_cxk() rather
        than querying the context for packm kernels (or even using scal2m).
      - Providing two variants of packm, one of which calls the
        aforementioned packm_cxk(), the other of which inlines the contents
        of packm_cxk() into the variant itself, making it self-contained.
        To switch from one to the other, simply change which function gets
        called within bls_packm_a() and bls_packm_b().
      - Simplified and cleaned up some variant names in both variants of
        packm, relative to their parent code.

    Add dependency on the "flat" blis.h file for the BLIS and BLAS testsuite objects.
    
    This fixes a bug where "make -j<N> check" may fail after a change to one or more header files, or where testsuite code doesn't get properly recompiled after internal changes.

    Disabled sanity check in bli_pool_finalize().
    
    Details:
    - Disabled a sanity check in bli_pool_finalize() that was meant to alert
      the user if a pool_t was being finalized while some blocks were still
      checked out. However, this is exactly the situation that might happen
      when a pool_t is re-initialized for a larger blocksize, and currently
      bli_pool_reinit() is implemeneted as _finalize() followed by _init().
      So, this sanity check is not universally appropriate. Thanks to
      AMD-India for reporting this issue.

    Fixed stale API calls to membrk API in gemmlike.
    
    Details:
    - Updated stale calls to the bli_membrk API within the 'gemmlike'
      sandbox. This API is now called bli_pba (packed block allocator).
      Ideally, this forgotten update would have been included as part of
      21911d6, which is when the branch where the membrk->pba changes was
      introduced was merged into 'master'.
    - Comment updates.

    Implement proposed new function pointer fields for obj_t.
    
    The added fields:
    1. `pack_t schema`: storing the pack schema on the object allows the macrokernel to act accordingly without side-channel information from the rntm_t and cntx_t. The pack schema and "pack_[ab]" fields could be removed from those structs.
    2. `void* user_data`: this field can be used to store any sort of additional information provided by the user. The pointer is propagated to submatrix objects and copies, but is otherwise ignored by the framework and the default implementations of the following three fields. User-specified pack, kernel, or ukr functions can do whatever they want with the data, and the user is 100% responsible for allocating, assigning, and freeing this buffer.
    3. `obj_pack_fn_t pack`: the function called when a matrix is packed. This functions receives the expected arguments, as well as a mdim_t and mem_t* as memory must be allocated inside this function, and behavior may differ based on which matrix is being backed (i.e. transposition for B). This could also be achieved by passing a desired pack schema, but this would require additional information to travel down the control tree.
    4. `obj_ker_fn_t ker`: the function called when we get to the "second loop", or the macro-kernel. Behavior may depend on the pack schemas of the input matrices. The default implementation would perform the inner two loops around the ukr, and then call either the default ukr or a user-supplied one (next field).
    5. `obj_ukr_fn_t ukr`: the function called by the default macrokernel. This would replace the various current "virtual" microkernels, and could also be used to supply user-defined behavior. Users could supply both a custom kernel (above) and microkernel, although the user-specified kernel does **not** necessarily have to call the ukr function specified on the obj_t.
    
    Note that no macros or functions for accessing these new fields have been defined yet. That is next once these are finalized. Addresses https://github.com/flame/blis/projects/1#card-62357687.

    Fixed bli_init.c compile-time error on OSX clang.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a compile-time error in bli_init.c when compiling with OSX's
      clang. This error was introduced in 868b901, which introduced a
      post-declaration struct assignment where the RHS was a struct
      initialization expression (i.e. { ... }). This use of struct
      initializer expressions apparently works with gcc despite it not
      being strict C99. The fix included in this commit declares a temporary
      variable for the purposes of being initialized to the desired value,
      via the struct initializer, and then copies the temporary struct (via
      '=' struct assignment) to the persistent struct. Thanks to Devin
      Matthews for his help with this.

    Fixed one-time use property of bli_init() (#525).
    
    Details:
    - Fixes a rather obvious bug that resulted in segmentation fault
      whenever the calling application tried to re-initialize BLIS after
      its first init/finalize cycle. The bug resulted from the fact that
      the bli_init.c APIs made no effort to allow bli_init() to be called
      subsequent times at all due to it, and bli_finalize(), being
      implemented in terms of pthread_once(). This has been fixed by
      resetting the pthread_once_t control variable for initialization
      at the end of bli_finalize_apis(), and by resetting the control
      variable for finalization at the end of bli_init_apis(). Thanks to
      @lschork2 for reporting this issue (#525), and to Minh Quan Ho and
      Devin Matthews for suggesting the chosen solution.

    Details:
    - Added vzeroupper instruction to the end of all 'gemm' and 'gemmtrsm'
      microkernels so as to avoid a performance penalty when mixing AVX
      and SSE instructions. These vzeroupper instructions were once part
      of the haswell kernels, but were inadvertently removed during a source
      code shuffle some time ago when we were managing duplicate 'haswell'
      and 'zen' kernel sets. Thanks to Devin Matthews for tracking this down
      and re-inserting the missing instructions.

    - Add a testsuite for gathering performance (in GFLOPs) and measuring correctness for the POWER10 GEMM reduced precision/integer kernels.
    - Reworked GENERIC_GEMM template to hardcode the cache parameters.
    - Remove kernel wrapper that checked that only allowed matrices that weren't transposed or conjugated. However, the kernels still assume the matrices are not transposed. This wrapper was removed for performance reasons.
    - Renamed and restructured files and functions for clarity.
    - Editted the POWER10 document to reflect new changes.

    Skip clearing temp microtile in gemmlike sandbox.
    
    Details:
    - Removed code from gemmlike sandbox files bls_gemm_bp_var1.c and
      bls_gemm_bp_var2.c that initializes the elements of the temporary
      microtile to zero. This code, introduced recently in 7f7d726, did
      not actually fix any bug (despite that commit's log entry). The
      microtile does not need to be initialized because it is completely
      overwritten by a "beta = 0" invocation of gemm prior to it being
      read. Any NaNs or Infs present at the outset would have no impact
      on the output matrix C. Thanks to Devin Matthews for reminding me
      of this.

    Sandbox header edits trigger full library rebuild.
    
    Details:
    - Adjusted the top-level Makefile so that any change to a sandbox header
      file will result in blis.h being regenerated along with a full
      recompilation of the library. Previously, sandbox files were omitted
      from the list of header files that, when touched, could trigger a full
      rebuild. Why was it like that previously? Because originally we only
      envisioned using sandboxes to *replace* gemm, not augment the library
      with new functionality. When replacing gemm, blis.h does not need to
      contain any local sandbox defintions in order for the user to be able
      to (indirectly) use that sandbox. But if you are adding functions to
      the library, those functions need to be prototyped so the compiler
      can perform type checking against the user's invocation of those new
      functions. Thanks to Jeff Diamond for helping us discover this
      deficiency in the build system.

    Fixed bugs in cpackm kernels, gemmlike code.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed intermittent bugs in bli_packm_haswell_asm_c3xk.c and
      bli_packm_haswell_asm_c8xk.c whereby the imaginary component of the
      kappa scalar was incorrectly loaded at an offset of 8 bytes (instead
      of 4 bytes) from the real component. This was almost certainly a copy-
      paste bug carried over from the corresonding zpackm kernels. Thanks to
      Devin Matthews for bringing this to my attention.
    - Added missing code to gemmlike sandbox files bls_gemm_bp_var1.c and
      bls_gemm_bp_var2.c that initializes the elements of the temporary
      microtile to zero. (This bug was never observed in output but rather
      noticed analytically. It probably would have also manifested as
      intermittent failures, this time involving edge cases.)
    - Minor commented-out/disabled changes to testsuite/src/test_gemm.c
      relating to debugging.

    Armv8A Rename Regs for Safe Darwin Compile
    
    Avoid x18 use in FP32 kernel:
    - C address lines x[18-26] renamed to x[19-27] (reg index +1)
    - Original role of x27 fulfilled by x5 which is free after k-loop pert.
    
    FP64 does not require changing since x18 is not used there.

    Armv8A Rename Regs for Clang Compile: FP64 Part
    
    - x7, x8: Used to store address for Alpha and Beta.
      As Alpha & Beta was not used in k-loops, use x0, x1 to load
      Alpha & Beta's addresses after k-loops are completed, since A & B's
      addresses are no longer needed there.
      This "ldr [addr]; -> ldr val, [addr]" would not cause much performance
      drawback since it is done outside k-loops and there are plenty of
      instructions between Alpha & Beta's loading and usage.
    - x9: Used to store cs_c. x9 is multiplied by 8 into x10 and not used
      any longer. Directly loading cs_c and into x10 and scale by 8 spares
      x9 straightforwardly.
    - x11, x12: Not used at all. Simply remove from clobber list.
    - x13: Alike x9, loaded and scaled by 8 into x14, except that x13 is
      also used in a conditional branch so that "cmp x13, #1" needs to be
      modified into "cmp x14, #8" to completely free x13.
    - x3, x4: Used to store next_a & next_b. Untouched in k-loops. Load
      these addresses into x0 and x1 after Alpha & Beta are both loaded,
      since then neigher address of A/B nor address of Alpha/Beta is needed.

    Added a new 'gemmlike' sandbox.
    
    Details:
    - Added a new sandbox called 'gemmlike', which implements sequential and
      multithreaded gemm in the style of gemmsup but also unconditionally
      employs packing. The purpose of this sandbox is to
      (1) avoid select abstractions, such as objects and control trees, in
          order to allow readers to better understand how a real-world
          implementation of high-performance gemm can be constructed;
      (2) provide a starting point for expert users who wish to build
          something that is gemm-like without "reinventing the wheel."
      Thanks to Jeff Diamond, Tze Meng Low, Nicholai Tukanov, and Devangi
      Parikh for requesting and inspiring this work.
    - The functions defined in this sandbox currently use the "bls_" prefix
      instead of "bli_" in order to avoid any symbol collisions in the main
      library.
    - The sandbox contains two variants, each of which implements gemm via a
      block-panel algorithm. The only difference between the two is that
      variant 1 calls the microkernel directly while variant 2 calls the
      microkernel indirectly, via a function wrapper, which allows the edge
      case handling to be abstracted away from the classic five loops.
    - This sandbox implementation utilizes the conventional gemm microkernel
      (not the skinny/unpacked gemmsup kernels).
    - Updated some typos in the comments of a few files in the main
      framework.

    Added 512b SVE-based a64fx subconfig + SVE kernels.
    
    Details:
    - Added 512-bit specific 'a64fx' subconfiguration that uses empirically
      tuned block size by Stepan Nassyr. This subconfig also sets the sector
      cache size and enables memory-tagging code in SVE gemm kernels. This
      subconfig utilizes (16, k) and (10, k) DPACKM kernels.
    - Added a vector-length agnostic 'armsve' subconfiguration that computes
      blocksizes according to the analytical model. This part is ported from
      Stepan Nassyr's repository.
    - Implemented vector-length-agnostic [d/s/sh] gemm kernels for Arm SVE
      at size (2*VL, 10). These kernels use unindexed FMLA instructions
      because indexed FMLA takes 2 FMA units in many implementations.
      PS: There are indexed-FLMA kernels in Stepan Nassyr's repository.
    - Implemented 512-bit SVE dpackm kernels with in-register transpose
      support for sizes (16, k) and (10, k).
    - Extended 256-bit SVE dpackm kernels by Linaro Ltd. to 512-bit for
      size (12, k). This dpackm kernel is not currently used by any
      subconfiguration.
    - Implemented several experimental dgemmsup kernels which would
      improve performance in a few cases. However, those dgemmsup kernels
      generally underperform hence they are not currently used in any
      subconfig.
    - Note: This commit squashes several commits submitted by RuQing Xu via
      PR #424.

    Use extra #undef when including ba/ex API headers.
    
    Details:
    - Inserted a "#include bli_xapi_undef.h" after each usage of the basic
      and expert API macro setup headers: bli_oapi_ba.h, bli_oapi_ex.h,
      bli_tapi_ba.h, and bli_tapi_ex.h. This is functionally equivalent to
      the previous status quo, in which each header made minimal #undef
      prior to its own definitions and then a single instance of
      "#include bli_xapi_undef.h" cleaned up any remaining macro defs after
      all other headers were used. This commit will guarantee that macro
      defs from the setup of one header (say, bli_oapi_ex.h) don't "infect"
      the definitions made in a subsequent header. As with this previous
      commit, this change does not fix any issue but rather attempts to
      avoid creating orphaned macro definitions that are only needed within
      a very limited scope.
    - Removed minimal #undef from bli_?api_[ba|ex].h.
    - Removed old commented-out lines from bli_?api_[ba|ex].h.

    Minor preprocessor/header cleanup.
    
    Details:
    - Added frame/include/bli_xapi_undef.h, which explicitly undefines all
      macros defined in bli_oapi_ba.h, bli_oapi_ex.h, bli_tapi_ba.h, and
      bli_tapi_ex.h. (This is for safety and good cpp coding practice, not
      because it fixes anything.)
    - Added #include "bli_xapi_undef.h" to bli_l1v.h, bli_l1d.h, bli_l1f.h,
      bli_l1m.h, bli_l2.h, bli_l3.h, and bli_util.h.
    - Comment updates to bli_oapi_ba.h, bli_oapi_ex.h, bli_tapi_ba.h, and
      bli_tapi_ex.h.
    - Moved frame/3/bli_l3_ft_ex.h to local 'old' directory after realizing
      that nothing in BLIS used those function pointer types. Also commented
      out the "#include bli_l3_ft_ex.h" directive in frame/3/bli_l3.h.

    Defined eqsc, eqv, eqm to test object equality.
    
    Details:
    - Defined eqsc, eqv, and eqm operations, which set a bool depending on
      whether the two scalars, two vectors, or two matrix operands are equal
      (element-wise). eqsc and eqv support implicit conjugation and eqm
      supports diagonal offset, diag, uplo, and trans parameters (in a
      manner consistent with other level-1m operations). These operations
      are currently housed under frame/util, at least for now, because they
      are not computational in nature.
    - Redefined bli_obj_equals() in terms of eqsc, eqv, and eqm.
    - Documented eqsc, eqv, and eqm in BLISObjectAPI.md and BLISTypedAPI.md.
      Also:
      - Documented getsc and setsc in both docs.
      - Reordered entry for setijv in BLISTypedAPI.md, and added separator
        bars to both docs.
      - Added missing "Observed object properties" clauses to various
        levle-1v entries in BLISObjectAPI.md.
    - Defined bli_apply_trans() in bli_param_macro_defs.h.
    - Defined supporting _check() function, bli_l0_xxbsc_check(), in
      bli_l0_check.c for eqsc.
    - Programming style and whitespace updates to bli_l1m_unb_var1.c.
    - Whitespace updates to bli_l0_oapi.c, bli_l1m_oapi.c
    - Consolidated redundant macro redefinition for copym function pointer
      type in bli_l1m_ft.h.
    - Added macros to bli_oapi_ba.h, _ex.h, and bli_tapi_ba.h, _ex.h that
      allow oapi and tapi source files to forego defining certain expert
      functions. (Certain operations such as printv and printm do not need
      to have both basic expert interfaces. This also includes eqsc, eqv,
      and eqm.)

      Matthews for providing this patch, and to Stefano Zampini for
      reporting the issue (#497) that prompted Devin to propose the patch.

    - Renamed bli_setgetij.c and .h to bli_setgetijm.c and .h, respectively.
    - Added additional bounds checking to getijm and setijm to prevent
      actions with negative indices.
    - Added documentation to BLISObjectAPI.md and BLISTypedAPI.md for getijv
      and setijv.
    - Added documentation to BLISTypedAPI.md for getijm and setijm, which
      were inadvertently missing.

    Minor API breakage in bli_pack API.
    
    Details:
    - Changed bli_pack_get_pack_a() and bli_pack_get_pack_b() so that
      instead of returning a bool, they set a bool that is passed in by
      address. This does break the public exported API, but I expect very
      few users actually use this function. (This change is being made in
      preparation for a much more extensive commit relating to error
      checking.)

    Added Fujitsu A64fx (512-bit SVE) perf results.
    
    Details:
    - Added single-threaded and multithreaded performance results to
      docs/Performance.md. These results were gathered on the "Fugaku"
      Fujitsu A64fx supercomputer at the RIKEN Center for Computational
      Science in Kobe, Japan. Special thanks to RuQing Xu and Stepan
      Nassyr for their work in developing and optimizing A64fx support in
      BLIS and RuQing for gathering the performance data that is reflected
      in these new graphs.

    Add err_t* "return" parameter to malloc functions.
    
    Details:
    - Added an err_t* parameter to memory allocation functions including
      bli_malloc_intl(), bli_calloc_intl(), bli_malloc_user(),
      bli_fmalloc_align(), and bli_fmalloc_noalign(). Since these functions
      already use the return value to return the allocated memory address,
      they can't communicate errors to the caller through the return value.
      This commit does not employ any error checking within these functions
      or their callers, but this sets up BLIS for a more comprehensive
      commit that moves in that direction.
    - Moved the typedefs for malloc_ft and free_ft from bli_malloc.h to
      bli_type_defs.h. This was done so that what remains of bli_malloc.h
      can be included after the definition of the err_t enum. (This ordering
      was needed because bli_malloc.h now contains function prototypes that
      use err_t.)
    - Defined bli_is_success() and bli_is_failure() static functions in
      bli_param_macro_defs.h. These functions provide easy checks for error
      codes and will be used more heavily in future commits.
    - Unfortunately, the additional err_t* argument discussed above breaks
      the API for bli_malloc_user(), which is an exported symbol in the
      shared library. However, it's quite possible that the only application
      that calls bli_malloc_user()--indeed, the reason it is was marked for
      symbol exporting to begin with--is the BLIS testsuite. And if that's
      the case, this breakage won't affect anyone. Nonetheless, the "major"
      part of the so_version file has been updated accordingly to 4.0.0.

    Fixed bug in power10 microkernel I/O. (#488)
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in the POWER10 DGEMM kernel whereby the microkernel did
      not store the microtile result correctly due to incorrect indices
      calculations. (The error was introduced when I reorganized the
      'kernels/power10/3' directory.)

    Always stay initialized after BLAS compat calls.
    
    Details:
    - Removed the option to finalize BLIS after every BLAS call, which also
      means that BLIS would initialize at the beginning of every BLAS call.
      This option never really made sense and wasn't even implemented
      properly to begin with. (Because bli_init_auto() and _finalize_auto()
      were implemented in terms of bli_init_once() and _finalize_once(),
      respectively, the application would have only been able to call one
      BLAS routine before BLIS would find itself in a unusable, permanently
      uninitialized state.) Because this option was never meant for regular
      use, it never made it into configure as an actual configure-time
      option, and therefore this commit only removes parts of the code
      affected by the cpp macro guard BLIS_ENABLE_STAY_AUTO_INITIALIZED.

    Renamed membrk files/vars/functions to pba.
    
    Details:
    - Renamed the files, variables, and functions relating to the packing
      block allocator from its legacy name (membrk) to its current name
      (pba). This more clearly contrasts the packing block allocator with
      the small block allocator (sba).
    - Fixed a typo in bli_pack_set_pack_b(), defined in bli_pack.c, that
      caused the function to erroneously change the value of the pack_a
      field of the global rntm_t instead of the pack_b field. (Apparently
      nobody has used this API yet.)
    - Comment updates.

    Switch allocator mutexes to static initialization.
    
    Details:
    - Switched the small block allocator (sba), as defined in bli_sba.c and
      bli_apool.c, to static initialization of its internal mutex. Did a
      similar thing for the packing block allocator (pba), which appears as
      global_membrk in bli_membrk.c.
    - Commented out bli_membrk_init_mutex() and bli_membrk_finalize_mutex()
      to ensure they won't be used in the future.
    - In bli_thrcomm_pthreads.c and .h, removed old, commented-out cpp
      blocks guarded by BLIS_USE_PTHREAD_MUTEX.

    Made test/3/octave scripts robust to missing data.
    
    Details:
    - Modified the octave scripts in test/3 so that the script does not
      choke when one or more of the expected OpenBLAS, Eigen, or vendor data
      files is missing. (The BLIS data set, however, must be complete.) When
      a file is missing, that data series is simply not included on that
      particular graph. Also factored out a lot of the redundant logic from
      plot_panel_4x5.m into a separate function in read_data.m.

    Redefined BLIS_NUM_ARCHS to update automatically.
    
    Details:
    - Changed BLIS_NUM_ARCHS from a cpp macro definition to the last enum
      value in the arch_t enum. This means that it no longer needs to get
      updated manually whenever new subconfigurations are added to BLIS.
      Also removed the explicit initial index assigment of 0 from the
      first enum value, which was unnecessary due to how the C language
      standard mandates indexing of enum values. Thanks to Devin Matthews
      for originally submitting this as a PR in #446.
    - Updated docs/ConfigurationHowTo.md to reflect the aforementioned
      change.

    Disabled _self() and _equal() in bli_pthread API.
    
    Details:
    - Disabled the _self() and _equal() extensions to the bli_pthread API
      introduced in d479654. These functions were disabled after I realized
      that they aren't actually needed yet. Thanks to Devin Matthews for
      helping me reason through the appropriate consumer code that will
      appear in BLIS (eventually) in a future commit. (Also, I could never
      get the Windows branch to link properly in clang builds in AppVeyor.
      See the comment I left in the code, and #485, for more info.)

    Details:
    - Expanded the bli_pthread API to include equivalents to pthread_self()

      branches present within bli_pthread.c: systemless, Windows, and
      Linux/BSD.

    Details:
    - Reordered the definitions in the cpp branch in bli_pthreads.c that
      defines the bli_pthreads API in terms of Windows API calls. Also added
      missing comments that mark sections of the API, which brings the code
      into harmony with other cpp branches (as well as bli_pthread.h).

    Moved cpp macro redef of strerror_r to bli_env.c.
    
    Details:
    - Relocated the _MSC_VER-guarded cpp macro re-definition of strerror_r
      (in terms of strerror_s) from bli_thread.h to bli_env.c. It was
      likely left behind in bli_thread.h in a previous commit, when code
      that now resides in bli_env.c was moved from bli_thread.c. (I couldn't
      find any other instance of strerror_r being used in BLIS, so I moved
      the #define directly to bli_env.c rather than place it in bli_env.h.)
      The code that uses strerror_r is currently disabled, though, so this
      commit should have no affect on BLIS.

    Relocated gemmsup_ref general stride handling.
    
    Details:
    - Moved the logic that checks for general stridedness in any of the
      matrix operands in a gemmsup problem. The logic previously resided
      near the top of bli_gemmsup_int(), which is the thread entry point
      for the parallel region of the current gemmsup implementation. The
      problem with this setup was that the code would attempt to reject
      problems with any general-strided operands by returning BLIS_FAILURE,
      and that return value was then being ignored by the l3_sup thread
      decorator, which unconditionally returns BLIS_SUCCESS. To solve this
      issue, rather than try to manage n return values, one from each of n
      threads, I simply moved the logic into bli_gemmsup_ref(). I didn't
      move it any higher (e.g. bli_gemmsup()) because I still want the
      logic to be part of the current gemmsup handler implementation. That
      is, perhaps someone else will create a different handler, and that
      author wants to handle general stride differently. (We don't want to
      force them into a particular way of handling general stride.)
    - Removed the general stride handling from bli_gemmtsup_int(), even
      though this function is inoperative for now.
    - This commit addresses issue #484. Thanks to RuQing Xu for reporting
      this issue.

    Add low-precision POWER10 gemm kernels (#467)
    
    Details:
    - This commit adds a new BLIS sandbox that (1) provides implementations
      based on low-precision gemm kernels, and (2) extends the BLIS typed
      API for those new implementations. Currently, these new kernels can
      only be used for the POWER10 microarchitecture; however, they may
      provide a template for developing similar kernels for other
      microarchitectures (even those beyond POWER), as changes would likely
      be limited to select places in the microkernel and possibly the
      packing routines. The new low-precision operations that are now
      supported include: shgemm, sbgemm, i16gemm, i8gemm, i4gemm. For more
      information, refer to the POWER10.md document that is included in
      'sandbox/power10'.

    Details:
    - Fixed incorrect definition and prototype of bli_?gemmt() in
      frame/3/bli_l3_tapi.c and .h, respectively. gemmt was previously
      defined identically to gemm, which was wrong because it did not
      take into account the uplo property of C.
    - Fixed incorrect API documentation for her2k/syr2k in BLISTypedAPI.md.
      Specifically, the document erroneously listed only a single transab
      parameter instead of transa and transb.

    Added complex asm packm kernels for 'haswell' set.
    
    Details:
    - Implemented assembly-based packm kernels for single- and double-
      precision complex domain (c and z) and housed them in the 'haswell'
      kernel set. This means c3xk, c8xk, z3xk, and z4xk are now all
      optimized.
    - Registered the aforementioned packm kernels in the haswell, zen,
      and zen2 subconfigs.
    - Minor modifications to the corresponding s and d packm kernels that
      were introduced in 426ad67.
    - Thanks to AMD, who originally contributed the double-precision real
      packm kernels (d6xk and d8xk), upon which these complex kernels are
      partially based.

    Support trsm pre-inversion in 1m, bb, ref kernels.
    
    Details:
    - Expanded support for disabling trsm diagonal pre-inversion to other
      microkernel types, including the reference microkernel as well as the
      kernel implementations for 1m and the pre-broadcast B (bb) format used
      by the power9 subconfig. This builds on the 'haswell' and 'penryn'
      kernel support added in 7038bba. Thanks to Bhaskar Nallani for
      reminding me, in #461 (post-closure), that 1m support was missing from
      that commit.
    - Removed cpp branch of ref_kernels/3/bli_trsm_ref.c that contained the
      omp simd implementation after making a stripped-down copy in 'old'.
      This code has been disabled for some time and it seemed better suited
      to rot away out of sight rather than clutter up a file that is already
      cluttered by the presence of lower and upper versions.
    - Minor comment update to bli_ind_init().

    Enable 1m only if real domain ukr is not reference.
    
    Details:
    - Previously, BLIS would automatically enable use of the 1m method
      for a given precision if the complex domain microkernel was a
      reference kernel. This commit adds an additional constraint so that
      1m is only enabled if the corresponding real domain microkernel is
      NOT reference. That is, BLIS now forgos use of 1m if both the real and
      complex domain kernels are reference implementations. Note that this
      does not prevent 1m from being enabled manually under those
      conditions; it only means that 1m will not be enabled automatically
      at initialization-time.

    Consolidated code in level-3 _front() functions.
    
    Details:
    - Reduced a code segment that appears in all of the bli_*_front()
      functions except for bli_gemm_front(). Previously, the code looked
      like this (taken from bli_herk_front()):
    
        if ( bli_cntx_method( cntx ) == BLIS_NAT )
        {
            bli_obj_set_pack_schema( BLIS_PACKED_ROW_PANELS, &a_local );
            bli_obj_set_pack_schema( BLIS_PACKED_COL_PANELS, &ah_local );
        }
        else // if ( bli_cntx_method( cntx ) != BLIS_NAT )
        {
            pack_t schema_a = bli_cntx_schema_a_block( cntx );
            pack_t schema_b = bli_cntx_schema_b_panel( cntx );
    
            bli_obj_set_pack_schema( schema_a, &a_local );
            bli_obj_set_pack_schema( schema_b, &ah_local );
        }
    
      This code segment is part of a sort-of-hack that allows us to
      communicate the pack schemas into the level-3 thread decorator, which
      needs them so that they can be passed into bli_l3_cntl_create_if(),
      where the control tree is created. However, the first conditional case
      above is unnecessary because the second case is fully generalized.
      That is, even in the native case, the context contains correct,
      queryable schemas. Thus, these code segments were reduced to something
      like:
    
        pack_t schema_a = bli_cntx_schema_a_block( cntx );
        pack_t schema_b = bli_cntx_schema_b_panel( cntx );
    
        bli_obj_set_pack_schema( schema_a, &a_local );
        bli_obj_set_pack_schema( schema_b, &ah_local );
    
      There's always a small chance that the seemingly unnecessary code
      in the first branch case has some special use that is not apparent to
      me, but the testsuite's default input parameters seem to think this
      commit will be fine.

    Optionally disable trsm diagonal pre-inversion.
    
    Details:
    - Implemented a configure-time option, --disable-trsm-preinversion, that
      optionally disables the pre-inversion of diagonal elements of the
      triangular matrix in the trsm operation and instead uses division
      instructions within the gemmtrsm microkernels. Pre-inversion is
      enabled by default. When it is disabled, performance may suffer
      slightly, but numerical robustness should improve for certain
      pathological cases involving denormal (subnormal) numbers that would
      otherwise result in overflow in the pre-inverted value. Thanks to
      Bhaskar Nallani for reporting this issue via #461.
    - Added preprocessor macro guards to bli_trsm_cntl.c as well as the
      gemmtrsm microkernels for 'haswell' and 'penryn' kernel sets pursuant
      to the aforementioned feature.
    - Added macros to frame/include/bli_x86_asm_macros.h related to division
      instructions.

    Allow amaxv testsuite module to run with dim = 0.
    
    Details:
    - Exit early from libblis_test_amaxv_check() when the vector dimension
      (length) of x is 0. This allows the module to run when the testsuite
      driver passes in a problem size of 0. Thanks to Meghana Vankadari for
      alerting us to this issue via #459.
    - Note: All other testsuite modules appear to work with problem sizes
      of 0, except for the microkernel modules. I chose not to "fix" those
      modules because a failure (or segmentation fault, as happens in this
      case) is actually meaningful in that it alerts the developer that some
      microkernels cannot be used with k = 0. Specifically, the 'haswell'
      kernel set contains microkernels that preload elements of B. Those
      microkernels would need to be restructured to avoid preloading in
      order to support usage when k = 0.

    - Fixed a bug in the gemmt testsuite module that only manifested when

      was due to a copy-paste error dating back to the introduction of gemmt
      in 88ad841.

    Fixed copy-paste bugs in edge-case sup kernels.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed bugs in two sup kernels, bli_dgemmsup_rv_haswell_asm_1x6() and
      bli_dgemmsup_rd_haswell_asm_1x4(), which involved extraneous assembly
      instructions that were left over from when the kernels were first
      written. These instructions would cause segmentation faults in some
      situations where extra memory was not allocated beyond the end of
      the matrix buffers. Thanks to Kiran Varaganti for reporting these
      bugs and to Bhaskar Nallani for identifying the cause and solution.

    Reorganized thread auto-factorization logic.
    
    Details:
    - Reorganized logic of bli_thread_partition_2x2() so that the primary
      guts were factored out into "fast" and "slow" variants. Then added
      logic to the "fast" variant that allows for more optimal thread
      factorizations in some situations where there is at least one factor
      of 2.
    - Changed BLIS_THREAD_RATIO_M from 2 to 1 in bli_kernel_macro_defs.h and
      added comments to that file describing BLIS_THREAD_RATIO_? and
      BLIS_THREAD_MAX_?R.
    - In bli_family_zen.h and bli_family_zen2.h, preprocessed out several
      macros not used in vanilla BLIS and removed the unused macro
      BLIS_ENABLE_ZEN_BLOCK_SIZES from the former file.
    - Disabled AMD's small matrix handling entry points in bli_syrk_front.c
      and bli_trsm_front.c. (These branches of small matrix handling have
      not been reviewed by vanilla BLIS developers.)
    - Added commented-out calls printf() to bli_rntm.c.
    - Whitespace changes to bli_thread.c.

    Auto-reduce (by default) prime numbers of threads.
    
    Details:
    - When requesting multithreaded parallelism by specifying the total
      number of threads (whether it be via environment variable, globally at
      runtime, or locally at runtime), reduce the number of threads actually
      used by one if the original value (a) is prime and (b) exceeds a
      minimum threshold defined by the macro BLIS_NT_MAX_PRIME, which is set
      to 11 by default. If, when specifying the total number of threads (and
      not the individual ways of parallelism for each loop), prime numbers
      of threads are desired, this feature may be overridden by defining the
      BLIS_ENABLE_AUTO_PRIME_NUM_THREADS macro in the bli_family_*.h that
      corresponds to the configuration family targeted at configure-time.
      (For now, there is no configure option(s) to control this feature.)
      Thanks to Jeff Diamond for suggesting this change.
    - Defined a new function in bli_thread.c, bli_is_prime(), that returns a
      bool that determines whether an integer is prime. This function is
      implemented in terms of existing functions in bli_thread.c.
    - Updated docs/Multithreading.md to document the above feature, along
      with unrelated minor edits.

    Added support for systemless build (no pthreads).
    
    Details:
    - Added a configure option, --[enable|disable]-system, which determines
      whether the modest operating system dependencies in BLIS are included.
      The most notable example of this on Linux and BSD/OSX is the use of
      POSIX threads to ensure thread safety for when application-level
      threads call BLIS. When --disable-system is given, the bli_pthreads
      implementation is dummied out entirely, allowing the calling code
      within BLIS to remain unchanged. Why would anyone want to build BLIS
      like this? The motivating example was submitted via #454 in which a
      user wanted to build BLIS for a simulator such as gem5 where thread
      safety may not be a concern (and where the operating system is largely
      absent anyway). Thanks to Stepan Nassyr for suggesting this feature.
    - Another, more minor side effect of the --disable-system option is that
      the implementation of bli_clock() unconditionally returns 0.0 instead
      of the time elapsed since some fixed point in the past. The reasoning
      for this is that if the operating system is truly minimal, the system
      function call upon which bli_clock() would normally be implemented
      (e.g. clock_gettime()) may not be available.
    - Refactored preprocess-guarded code in bli_pthread.c and bli_pthread.h
      to remove redundancies.
    - Removed old comments and commented #include of "bli_pthread_wrap.h"
      from bli_system.h.
    - Documented bli_clock() and bli_clock_min_diff() in BLISObjectAPI.md
      and BLISTypedAPI.md, with a note that both are non-functional when
      BLIS is configured with --disable-system.

    Squash-merge 'pr' into 'squash'. (#457)
    
    Merged contributions from AMD's AOCL BLIS (#448).
    
    Details:
    - Added support for level-3 operation gemmt, which performs a gemm on
      only the lower or upper triangle of a square matrix C. For now, only
      the conventional/large code path will be supported (in vanilla BLIS).
      This was accomplished by leveraging the existing variant logic for
      herk. However, some of the infrastructure to support a gemmtsup is
      included in this commit, including
      - A bli_gemmtsup() front-end, similar to bli_gemmsup().
      - A bli_gemmtsup_ref() reference handler function.
      - A bli_gemmtsup_int() variant chooser function (with variant calls
        commented out).
    - Added support for inducing complex domain gemmt via the 1m method.
    - Added gemmt APIs to the BLAS and CBLAS compatiblity layers.
    - Added gemmt test module to testsuite.
    - Added standalone gemmt test driver to 'test' directory.
    - Documented gemmt APIs in BLISObjectAPI.md and BLISTypedAPI.md.
    - Added a C++ template header (blis.hh) containing a BLAS-inspired
      wrapper to a set of polymorphic CBLAS-like function wrappers defined
      in another header (cblas.hh). These two headers are installed if
      running the 'install' target with INSTALL_HH is set to 'yes'. (Also
      added a set of unit tests that exercise blis.hh, although they are
      disabled for now because they aren't compatible with out-of-tree
      builds.) These files now live in the 'vendor' top-level directory.
    - Various updates to 'zen' and 'zen2' subconfigurations, particularly
      within the context initialization functions.
    - Added s and d copyv, setv, and swapv kernels to kernels/zen/1, and
      various minor updates to dotv and scalv kernels. Also added various
      sup kernels contributed by AMD to kernels/zen/3. However, these
      kernels are (for now) not yet used, in part because they caused
      AppVeyor clang failures, and also because I have not found time to
      review and vet them.
    - Output the python found during configure into the definition of PYTHON
      in build/config.mk (via build/config.mk.in).
    - Added early-return checks (A, B, or C with zero dimension; alpha = 0)
      to bli_gemm_front.c.
    - Implemented explicit beta = 0 handling in for the sgemm ukernel in
      bli_gemm_armv7a_int_d4x4.c, which was previously missing. This latent
      bug surfaced because the gemmt module verifies its computation using
      gemm with its beta parameter set to zero, which, on a cortexa15 system
      caused the gemm kernel code to unconditionally multiply the
      uninitialized C data by beta. The C matrix likely contained
      non-numeric values such as NaN, which then would have resulted in a
      false failure.
    - Fixed a bug whereby the implementation for bli_herk_determine_kc(),
      in bli_l3_blocksize.c, was inadvertantly being defined in terms of
      helper functions meant for trmm. This bug was probably harmless since
      the trmm code should have also done the right thing for herk.
    - Used cpp macros to neutralize the various AOCL_DTL_TRACE_ macros in
      kernels/zen/3/bli_gemm_small.c since those macros are not used in
      vanilla BLIS.
    - Added cpp guard to definition of bli_mem_clear() in bli_mem.h to
      accommodate C++'s stricter type checking.
    - Added cpp guard to test/*.c drivers that facilitate compilation on
      Windows systems.
    - Various whitespace changes.

    Relocated operation index to ToC in API docs.
    
    Details:
    - Moved the "Operation index" section of both the BLISObjectAPI.md and
      BLISTypedAPI.md docs to appear immediately after the table of contents
      of each document. This allows the reader to quickly jump to the
      documentation for any operation without having to scroll through much

    - Fixed a mistake in the BLISObjectAPI.md for the setd operation, which
      does *not* observe the diag property of its matrix argument. Thanks to
      Jeff Diamond for reporting this.

    Implemented runtime subconfig selection (#451).
    
    Details:
    - Implemented support for the user manually overriding the automatic
      subconfiguration selection that happens at runtime. This override
      can be requested by setting the BLIS_ARCH_TYPE environment variable.
      The variable must be set to the arch_t id (as enumerated in
      bli_type_defs.h) corresponding to the desired subconfiguration. If a
      value outside this enumerated range is given, BLIS will abort with an
      error message. If the value is in the valid range but corresponds to a
      subconfiguration that was not activated at configure-time/compile-time,
      BLIS will abort with a (different) error message. Thanks to decandia50
      for suggesting this feature via issue #451.
    - Defined a new function bli_gks_lookup_id to return the address of an
      internal data structure within the gks. If this address is NULL, then
      it indicates that the subconfig corresponding to the arch_t id passed
      into the function was not compiled into BLIS. This function is used
      in the second of the two abort scenarios described above.
    - Defined the enumerated error code BLIS_UNINITIALIZED_GKS_CNTX, which
      is returned for the latter of the two abort scenarios mentioned above,
      along with a corresponding error message and a function to perform
      the error check.
    - Added cpp macro branching to bli_env.c to support compilation of the
      auto-detect.x executable during configure-time. This cpp branch is
      similar to the cpp code already found in bli_arch.c and bli_cpuid.c.
    - Cleaned up the auto_detect() function to facilitate easier maintenance
      going forward. Also added a convenient debug switch that outputs the
      compilation command for the auto-detect.x executable and exits.

    Added Epyc 7742 Zen2 ("Rome") sup perf results.
    
    Details:
    - Added single-threaded and multithreaded sup performance results to
      docs/PerformanceSmall.md for both sgemm and dgemm. These results were
      gathered on an Epyc 7742 "Rome" server featuring AMD's Zen2
      microarchitecture. Special thanks to Jeff Diamond for facilitating
      access to the system via the Oracle Cloud.
    - Updates to octave scripts in test/sup/octave for use with Octave 5.2
      and for use with subplot_tight().
    - Minor updates to octave scripts in test/3/octave.
    - Renamed files containing the previous Zen performance results for
      consistency with the new results.
    - Decreased line thickness slightly in large/conventional Zen2 graphs.
      I'm done tweaking those this time. Really.
    - Added missing line regarding eigen header installation for each
      microarchitecture section.

    Implemented sgemmsup assembly kernels.
    
    Details:
    - Created a set of single-precision real millikernels and microkernels
      comparable to the dgemmsup kernels that already exist within BLIS.
    - Added prototypes for all kernels within bli_kernels_haswell.h.
    - Registered entry-point millikernels in bli_cntx_init_haswell.c and
      bli_cntx_init_zen.c.
    - Added sgemmsup support to the Makefile, runme.sh script, and source
      file in test/sup. This included edits that allow for separate "small"
      dimensions for single- and double-precision as well as for single-
      vs. multithreaded execution.

    Details:
    - Changed double* pointers in sgemm function signature to float*. At
      this point I've lost track of whether this was my fault or another
      dormant bug like the one described in ece9f6a, but at this point I
      no longer care. It's one of those days (aka I didn't ask for this).

    Fixed dormant type bugs in bli_kernels_knl.h.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed dormant type mismatches in the use of the prototype-generating
      macros in bli_kernels_knl.h. Specifically, some float prototypes
      were incorrectly using double as their ctype. This didn't actually
      matter until the type changes in 645d771, as previously those types
      were not used since packm was prototyped with void* pointers.

    Fixed accidental breakage in 645d771.
    
    Details:
    - In trying to clean up kappa_cast variables in the reference packm
      kernels, which I initally believed to be redundant given the other
      void* -> ctype* changes in 645d771, I accidentally ended up violating
      restrict semantics for 1e/1r packing and possibly other packm kernels.
      (Normally, my pre-commit testsuite run would have caught this, but I
      was unknowingly using an edited input.operations file in which I'd
      disabled most tests as part of unrelated work.) This commit reverts
      the kappa_cast changes in 645d771.

    Minor packm kernel type cleanup (void* -> ctype*).
    
    Details:
    - Changed all void* function arguments in reference packm kernels to
      those of the native type (ctype*). These pointers no longer need to
      be void* and are better represented by their native types anyway.
      (See below for details.) Updated knl packm kernels accordingly.
    - In the definition of the PACKM_KER_PROT prototype macro template in
      frame/1m/bli_l1m_ker_prot.h, changed the pointer types for kappa, a,
      and p from void* to ctype*. They were originally void* because these
      function signatures had to share the same type so they could all be
      stored in a single array of that shared type, from which they were
      queried and called by packm_cxk(). This is no longer how the function
      pointers are stored, and so it no longer makes sense to force the
      caller of packm kernels to use void*, only so that the implementor
      of the packm kernels can typecast back to the native datatype within
      the kernel definition. This change has no effect internally within
      BLIS because currently all packm kernels are called after querying
      the function addresses from the context and then typecasting to the
      appropriate function pointer type, which is based upon type-specific
      function pointers like float* and double*.
    - Removed a comment in frame/1m/bli_l1m_ft_ker.h that was outdated and
      misleading due to changes to the handling of packm kernels since
      moving them into the context.

    Add an option to change the complex return type.
    
    ifort apparently does not return complex numbers in registers as in C/C++ (or gfortran), but instead creates a "hidden" first parameter for the return value. The option --complex-return=gnu|intel has been added, as well as a guess based on a provided FC if not specified (otherwise default to gnu). This option affects the signatures of cdotc, cdotu, zdotc, and zdotu, and a single library cannot be used with both GNU and Intel Fortran compilers. Fixes #433.

    Replaced use of bool_t type with C99 bool.
    
    Details:
    - Textually replaced nearly all non-comment instances of bool_t with the
      C99 bool type. A few remaining instances, such as those in the files
      bli_herk_x_ker_var2.c, bli_trmm_xx_ker_var2.c, and
      bli_trsm_xx_ker_var2.c, were promoted to dim_t since they were being
      used not for boolean purposes but to index into an array.
    - This commit constitutes the third phase of a transition toward using
      C99's bool instead of bool_t, which was raised in issue #420. The first
      phase, which cleaned up various typecasts in preparation for using
      bool as the basis for bool_t (instead of gint_t), was implemented by
      commit a69a4d7. The second phase, which redefined the bool_t typedef
      in terms of bool (from gint_t), was implemented by commit 2c554c2.

    Redefined bool_t typedef in terms of C99 bool.
    
    Details:
    - Changed the typedef that defines bool_t from:
    
        typedef gint_t bool_t;
    
      where gint_t is a signed integer that forms the basis of most other
      integers in BLIS, to:
    
        typedef bool bool_t;
    
    - Changed BLIS's TRUE and FALSE macro definitions from being in terms of
      integer literals:
    
        #define TRUE  1
        #define FALSE 0
    
      to being in terms of C99 boolean constants:
    
        #define TRUE  true
        #define FALSE false
    
      which are provided by stdbool.h.
    - This commit constitutes the second phase of a transition toward using
      C99's bool instead of bool_t, which will address issue #420. The first
      phase, which cleaned up various typecasts in preparation for using
      bool as the basis for bool_t (instead of gint_t), was implemented by
      commit a69a4d7.

    Fail-safe updates to Makefiles in 'test' dir.
    
    Details:
    - Updated Makefiles in test, test/3, and test/sup so that running any of
      the usual targets without having first built BLIS results in a helpful
      error message. For example, if BLIS is not yet configured, make will
      output:
    
        Makefile:327: *** Cannot proceed: config.mk not detected! Run
        configure first.  Stop.
    
      Similarly, if BLIS is configured but not yet built, make will output:
    
        Makefile:340: *** Cannot proceed: BLIS library not yet built! Run
        make first.  Stop.
    
      In previous commits, these actions would result in a rather cryptic
      make error such as:
    
        make: *** No rule to make target 'test_sgemm_2400_asm_blis_st.x',
        needed by 'blis-nat-st'.  Stop.

    Cleaned up bool_t usage and various typecasts.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed various typecasts in
    
        frame/base/bli_cntx.h
        frame/base/bli_mbool.h
        frame/base/bli_rntm.h
        frame/include/bli_misc_macro_defs.h
        frame/include/bli_obj_macro_defs.h
        frame/include/bli_param_macro_defs.h
    
      that were missing or being done improperly/incompletely. For example,
      many return values were being typecast as
        (bool_t)x && y
      rather than
        (bool_t)(x && y)
      Thankfully, none of these deficiencies had manifested as actual bugs
      at the time of this commit.
    - Changed the return type of bli_env_get_var() from dim_t to gint_t.
      This reflects the fact that bli_env_get_var() needs to be able to
      return a signed integer, and even though dim_t is currently defined
      as a signed integer, it does not intuitively appear to necessarily be
      signed by inspection (i.e., an integer named "dim_t" for matrix
      "dimension"). Also, updated use of bli_env_get_var() within
      bli_pack.c to reflect the changed return type.
    - Redefined type of thrcomm_t.barrier_sense field from bool_t to gint_t
      and added comments to the bli_thrcomm_*.h files that will explain a
      planned replacement of bool_t with C99's bool type.
    - Note: These changes are being made to facilitate the substitution of
      'bool' for 'bool_t', which will eliminate the namespace conflict with
      arm_sve.h as reported in issue #420. This commit implements the first
      phase of that transition. Thanks to RuQing Xu for reporting this
      issue.
    - CREDITS file update.

    Replaced broken ref99 sandbox w/ simpler version.
    
    Details:
    - The 'ref99' sandbox was broken by multiple refactorings and internal
      API changes over the last two years. Rather than try to fix it, I've
      replaced it with a much simpler version based on var2 of gemmsup.
      Why not fix the previous implementation? It occurred to me that the
      old implementation was trying to be a lightly simplified duplication
      of what exists in the framework. Duplication aside, this sandbox
      would have worked fine if it had been completely independent of the
      framework code. The problem was that it was only partially
      independent, with many function calls calling a function in BLIS
      rather than a duplicated/simplified version within the sandbox. (And
      the reason I didn't make it fully independent to begin with was that
      it seemed unnecessarily duplicative at the time.) Maintaining two
      versions of the same implementation is problematic for obvious
      reasons, especially when it wasn't even done properly to begin with.
      This explains the reimplementation in this commit. The only catch is
      that the newer implementation is single-threaded only and does not
      perform any packing on either input matrix (A or B). Basically, it's
      only meant to be a simple placeholder that shows how you could plug
      in your own implementation. Thanks to Francisco Igual for reporting
      this brokenness.
    - Updated the three reference gemmsup kernels (defined in
      ref_kernels/3/bli_gemmsup_ref.c) so that they properly handle
      conjugation of conja and/or conjb. The general storage kernel, which
      is currently identical to the column-storage kernel, is used in the
      new ref99 sandbox to provide basic support for all datatypes
      (including scomplex and dcomplex).
    - Minor updates to docs/Sandboxes.md, including adding the threading
      and packing limitations to the Caveats section.
    - Fixed a comment typo in bli_l3_sup_var1n2m.c (upon which the new
      sandbox implementation is based).

    Details:
    - Added support to bli_gemmsup_rv_haswell_asm_d6x8n.c for handling
      various n = 6 edge cases with a single sup kernel call. Previously,
      only n = {4,2,1} were handled explicitly as single kernel calls;
      that is, cases where n = 6 were previously being executed via two
      kernel calls (n = 4 and n = 2).
    - Added commented debug line to testsuite's test_libblis.c.

    Declare/define static functions via BLIS_INLINE.
    
    Details:
    - Updated all static function definitions to use the cpp macro
      BLIS_INLINE instead of the static keyword. This allows blis.h to
      use a different keyword (inline) to define these functions when
      compiling with C++, which might otherwise trigger "defined but
      not used" warning messages. Thanks to Giorgos Margaritis for
      reporting this issue and Devin Matthews for suggesting the fix.
    - Updated the following files, which are used by configure's
      hardware auto-detection facility, to unconditionally #define
      BLIS_INLINE to the static keyword (since we know BLIS will be
      compiled with C, not C++):

    Added -fomit-frame-pointer option to CKOPTFLAGS.
    
    Details:
    - Added the -fomit-frame-pointer compiler option to the CKOPTFLAGS
      variable in the following make_defs.mk files:
        config/haswell/make_defs.mk
        config/skx/make_defs.mk
      as well as comments that mention why the compiler option is needed.
      This option is needed to prevent the compiler from using the rbp
      frame register (in the very early portion of kernel code, typically
      where k_iter and k_left are defined and computed), which, as of
      1c719c9, is used explicitly by the gemmsup millikernels. Thanks to
      Devin Matthews for identifying this missing option and to Jeff
      Diamond for reporting the original bug in #417.
    - The file
        config/zen/amd_config.mk
      which feeds into the make_defs.mk for both zen and zen2 subconfigs,
      was also touched, but only to add a commented-out compiler option
      (and the aforementioned explanatory comment) since that file already
      uses -fomit-frame-pointer in COPTFLAGS, which forms the basis of
      CKOPTFLAGS.

    Fixed disabled edge case optimization in gemmsup.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed an inadvertently disabled edge case optimization in the two
      gemmsup variants in bli_l3_sup_var1n2m.c. Background: These edge case
      optimizations allow the last millikernel operation in the jr loop to
      be executed with inflated an register blocksize if it is the last
      (or only) iteration. For example, if mr=6 and nr=8 and the gemmsup
      problem is m=8, n=100, k=100. (In this case, the panel-block variant
      (var1n) is executed, which places the jr loop in the m dimension.)
      In principle, this problem could be executed as two millikernels: one
      with dimensions 6x100x100, and one as 2x100x100. However, with the
      support for inflated blocksizes in the kernel, the entire 8x100x100
      problem can be passed to the millikernel function, which will then
      execute it more favorably as two 4x100x100 millikernel sub-calls.
      Now, this optimization is disabled under certain circumstances, such
      as when multithreading. Previously, the is_mt predicate was being set
      incorrectly such that it was non-zero even when running
      single-threaded.
    - Upon fixing the is_mt issue above, another bit of code needed to be
      moved so that the result of the optimization could have an impact on
      the assignment of loop bounds ranges to threads.

    Support ldims, packing in sup/test drivers.
    
    Details:
    - Updated the test/sup source file (test_gemm.c) and Makefile to support
      building matrices with small or large leading dimensions, and updated
      runme.sh to support executing both kinds of test drivers.
    - Updated runme.sh to allow for executing sup drivers with unpacked (the
      default) or packed matrices (via setting BLIS_PACK_A, BLIS_PACK_B
      environment variables), and for capturing output to files that encode
      both the leading dimension (small or large) and packing status into
      the filenames.
    - Consolidated octave scripts in test/sup/octave_st, test/sup/octave_mt
      into test/sup/octave and updated the octave code in that consolidated
      directory to read the new output filename format (encoding ldim and
      packing). Also added comments and streamlined code, particularly in
      plot_panel_trxsh.m. Tested the octave scripts with octave 5.2.0.
    - Moved old octave_st, octave_mt directories to test/sup/old.

    Ensure random objects' 1-norms are non-zero.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed an innocuous bug that manifested when running the testsuite on
      extremely small matrices with randomization via the "powers of 2 in
      narrow precision range" option enabled. When the randomization
      function emits a perfect 0.0 to fill a 1x1 matrix, the testsuite will
      then compute 0.0/0.0 during the normalization process, which leads to
      NaN residuals. The solution entails smarter implementaions of randv,
      randnv, randm, and randnm, each of which will compute the 1-norm of
      the vector or matrix in question. If the object has a 1-norm of 0.0,
      the object is re-randomized until the 1-norm is not 0.0. Thanks to
      Kiran Varaganti for reporting this issue (#413).
    - Updated the implementation of randm_unb_var1() so that it loops over
      a call to the randv_unb_var1() implementation directly rather than
      calling it indirectly via randv(). This was done to avoid the overhead
      of multiple calls to norm1v() when randomizing the rows/columns of a
      matrix.
    - Updated comments.

    Bugfixes, cleanup of sup dgemm ukernels.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a few not-really-bugs:
      - Previously, the d6x8m kernels were still prefetching the next upanel
        of A using MR*rs_a instead of ps_a (same for prefetching of next
        upanel of B in d6x8n kernels using NR*cs_b instead of ps_b). Given
        that the upanels might be packed, using ps_a or ps_b is the correct
        way to compute the prefetch address.
      - Fixed an obscure bug in the rd_d6x8m kernel that, by dumb luck,
        executed as intended even though it was based on a faulty pointer
        management. Basically, in the rd_d6x8m kernel, the pointer for B
        (stored in rdx) was loaded only once, outside of the jj loop, and in
        the second iteration its new position was calculated by incrementing
        rdx by the *absolute* offset (four columns), which happened to be the
        same as the relative offset (also four columns) that was needed. It
        worked only because that loop only executed twice. A similar issue
        was fixed in the rd_d6x8n kernels.
    - Various cleanups and additions, including:
      - Factored out the loading of rs_c into rdi in rd_d6x8[mn] kernels so
        that it is loaded only once outside of the loops rather than
        multiple times inside the loops.
      - Changed outer loop in rd kernels so that the jump/comparison and
        loop bounds more closely mimic what you'd see in higher-level source
        code. That is, something like:
          for( i = 0; i < 6; i+=3 )
        rather than something like:
          for( i = 0; i <= 3; i+=3 )
      - Switched row-based IO to use byte offsets instead of byte column
        strides (e.g. via rsi register), which were known to be 8 anyway
        since otherwise that conditional branch wouldn't have executed.
      - Cleaned up and homogenized prefetching a bit.
      - Updated the comments that show the before and after of the
        in-register transpositions.
      - Added comments to column-based IO cases to indicate which columns
        are being accessed/updated.
      - Added rbp register to clobber lists.
      - Removed some dead (commented out) code.
      - Fixed some copy-paste typos in comments in the rv_6x8n kernels.
      - Cleaned up whitespace (including leading ws -> tabs).
      - Moved edge case (non-milli) kernels to their own directory, d6x8,
        and split them into separate files based on the "NR" value of the
        kernels (Mx8, Mx4, Mx2, etc.).
      - Moved config-specific reference Mx1 kernels into their own file
        (e.g. bli_gemmsup_r_haswell_ref_dMx1.c) inside the d6x8 directory.
      - Added rd_dMx1 assembly kernels, which seems marginally faster than
        the corresponding reference kernels.
      - Updated comments in ref_kernels/bli_cntx_ref.c and changed to using
        the row-oriented reference kernels for all storage combos.

    New kernel set for Arm SVE using assembly (#396)
    
    Here adds two kernels for Arm SVE vector extensions.
    1. a gemm  kernel for double at sizes 8x8.
    2. a packm kernel for double at dimension 8xk.
    
    To achive best performance, variable length agonostic programming
    is not used. Vector length (VL) of 256 bits is mandated in both kernels.
    Kernels to support other VLs can be added later.
    
    "SVE is a vector extension for AArch64 execution mode for the A64
    instruction set of the Armv8 architecture. Unlike other SIMD architectures,
    SVE does not define the size of the vector registers, but constrains into
    a range of possible values, from a minimum of 128 bits up to a maximum of
    2048 in 128-bit wide units. Therefore, any CPU vendor can implement the
    extension by choosing the vector register size that better suits the
    workloads the CPU is targeting. Instructions are provided specifically
    to query an implementation for its register size, to guarantee that

    Moved #include "cpuid.h" to bli_cpuid.c.
    
    Details:
    - Relocated the #include "cpuid.h" directive from bli_cpuid.h to
      bli_cpuid.c. This was done because cpuid.h (which is pulled into
      the post-build blis.h developer header) doesn't protect its
      definitions with a preprocessor guard of the form:
    
        #ifndef FOOBAR_H
        #define FOOBAR_H
        // header contents.
        #endif
    
      and as a result, applications (previously) could not #include both
      blis.h and cpuid.h (since the former was already including the
      latter). Thanks to Bhaskar Nallani for raising this issue via #393
      and to Devin Matthews for suggesting this fix.

    Disable packing by default in expert rntm_t init.
    
    Details:
    - Changed the behavior of bli_rntm_init() as well as the static
      initializer, BLIS_RNTM_INITIALIZER, so that user-initialized rntm_t
      objects by default specify the disabling of packing for A and B.
      Packing of A/B was already disabled by default when calling non-expert
      APIs (and enabled only when the user set environment variables
      BLIS_PACK_A or BLIS_PACK_B). With this commit, the default behavior of
      using user-initialized rntm_t objects with expert APIs comes into line
      with the default behavior of non-expert APIs--that is, they now both
      lead to the avoidance of packing in the sup code path. (Note: The
      conventional code path is unaffected by the environment variables
      BLIS_PACK_A/BLIS_PACK_B and/or the disabling of packing in a rntm_t
      object when calling an expert API.) This addresses issue #392. Thanks
      to Kiran Varaganti for bringing this inconsistency to our attention.
    - The above change was accomplished by changing the the definitions of
      static functions bli_rntm_clear_pack_a() and bli_rntm_clear_pack_b()
      in bli_rntm.h, which are both for internal use only.

    Warn user when auto-detection returns 'generic'.
    
    Details:
    - Added logic to configure that causes the script to output a warning
      to the user if/when "./configure auto" is run and the underlying
      hardware feature detection code is unable to identify the hardware.
      In these cases, the auto-detect code will return 'generic', which
      is likely not what the user expected, and a flag will be set so that
      a message is printed at the end of the configure output. (Thankfully,
      we don't expect this scenario to play out very often.) Thanks to
      Devin Matthews for suggesting this fix #384.

    Fix vectorized version of bli_amaxv (#382)
    
    * Fix vectorized version of bli_amaxv
    
    To match Netlib, i?amax should return:
    - the lowest index among equal values
    - the first NaN if one is encountered
    
    * Fix typos.
    
    * And another one...
    
    * Update ref. amaxv kernel too.
    
    * Re-enabled optimized amaxv kernels.
    
    Details:
    - Re-enabled the optimized, intrinsics-based amaxv kernels in the 'zen'
      kernel set for use in haswell, zen, zen2, knl, and skx subconfigs.
      These two kernels (for s and d datatypes) were temporarily disabled in
      e186d71 as part of issue #380. However, the key missing semantic
      properties that prompted the disabling of these kernels--returning the
      index of the *first* rather than of the last element with largest
      absolute value, and returning the index of the first NaN if one is
      encountered--were added as part of #382 thanks to Devin Matthews.
      Thus, now that the kernels are working as expected once more, this
      commit causes these kernels to once again be registered for the
      affected subconfigs, which effectively reverts all code changes
      included in e186d71.

    Disabled optimized amaxv kernels.
    
    Details:
    - Disabled use of optimized amaxv kernels, which use vector intrinsics
      for both 's' and 'd' datatypes. We disable these kernels because the
      current implementations fail to observe a semantic property of the
      BLAS i?amax_() subroutine, which is to return the index of the
      *first* element containing the maximum absolute value (that is, the
      first element if there exist two or more elements that contain the
      same value). With the optimized kernels disabled, the affected
      subconfigurations (haswell, zen, zen2, knl, and skx) will use the
      default reference implementations. Thanks to Mat Cross for reporting
      this issue via #380.

    Added missing return to bli_thread_partition_2x2().
    
    Details:
    - Added a missing return statement to the body of an early case handling
      branch in bli_thread_partition_2x2(). This bug only affected cases
      where n_threads < 4, and even then, the code meant to handle cases
      where n_threads >= 4 executes and does the right thing, albeit using
      more CPU cycles than needed. Nonetheless, thanks to Kiran Varaganti
      for reporting this bug via issue #377.
    - Whitespace changes to bli_thread.c (spaces -> tabs).

    Merged test/sup, test/supmt into test/sup.
    
    Details:
    - Updated the Makefile, test_gemm.c, and runme.sh in test/sup to be able
      to compile and run both single-threaded and multithreaded experiments.
      This should help with maintenance going forward.
    - Created a test/sup/octave_st directory of scripts (based on the
      previous test/sup/octave scripts) as well as a test/sup/octave_mt
      directory (based on the previous test/supmt/octave scripts). The
      octave scripts are slightly different and not easily mergeable, and
      thus for now I'll maintain them separately.
    - Preserved the previous test/sup directory as test/sup/old/supst and
      the previous test/supmt directory as test/sup/old/supmt.

    - Updated test/sup/Makefile and test/supmt/Makefile to allow specifying
      different problem size ranges for the drivers where one, two, or three
      matrix dimensions is large. This will facilitate the generation of
      more meaningful graphs, particularly when two dimensions are tiny.

        bli_thread_obarrier()   -> bli_thread_barrier()
        bli_thread_obroadcast() -> bli_thread_broadcast()
      The 'o' was a leftover from when thrcomm_t objects tracked both
      "inner" and "outer" communicators. They have long since been
      simplified to only support the latter, and thus the 'o' is
      superfluous.

    Skip building thrinfo_t tree when mt is disabled.
    
    Details:
    - Return early from bli_thrinfo_sup_grow() if the thrinfo_t object
      address is equal to either &BLIS_GEMM_SINGLE_THREADED or
      &BLIS_PACKM_SINGLE_THREADED.
    - Added preprocessor logic to bli_l3_sup_thread_decorator() in
      bli_l3_sup_decor_single.c that (by default) disables code that
      creates and frees the thrinfo_t tree and instead passes
      &BLIS_GEMM_SINGLE_THREADED as the thrinfo_t pointer into the
      sup implementation.
    - The net effect of the above changes is that a small amount of
      thrinfo_t overhead is avoided when running small/skinny dgemm
      problems when BLIS is compiled with multithreading disabled.

    Fixed bug(s) in mt sup when single-threaded.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a syntax bug in bli_l3_sup_decor_single.c as a result of
      changing function interface for the thread entry point function
      (of type l3supint_t).
    - Unfortunately, fixing the interface was not enough, as it caused
      a memory leak in the sba at bli_finalize() time. It turns out that,
      due to the new multithreading-capable variant code useing thrinfo_t
      objects--specifically, their calling of bli_thrinfo_grow()--we
      have to pass in a real thrinfo_t object rather than the global
      objects &BLIS_PACKM_SINGLE_THREADED or &BLIS_GEMM_SINGLE_THREADED.
      Thus, I inserted the appropriate logic from the OpenMP and pthreads
      versions so that single-threaded execution would work as intended
      with the newly upgraded variants.

    Support multithreading within the sup framework.
    
    Details:
    - Added multithreading support to the sup framework (via either OpenMP
      or pthreads). Both variants 1n and 2m now have the appropriate
      threading infrastructure, including data partitioning logic, to
      parallelize computation. This support handles all four combinations
      of packing on matrices A and B (neither, A only, B only, or both).
      This implementation tries to be a little smarter when automatic
      threading is requested (e.g. via BLIS_NUM_THREADS) in that it will
      recalculate the factorization in units of micropanels (rather than
      using the raw dimensions) in bli_l3_sup_int.c, when the final
      problem shape is known and after threads have already been spawned.
    - Implemented bli_?packm_sup_var2(), which packs to conventional row-
      or column-stored matrices. (This is used for the rrc and crc storage
      cases.) Previously, copym was used, but that would no longer suffice
      because it could not be parallelized.
    - Minor reorganization of packing-related sup functions. Specifically,
      bli_packm_sup_init_mem_[ab]() are called from within packm_sup_[ab]()
      instead of from the variant functions. This has the effect of making
      the variant functions more readable.
    - Added additional bli_thrinfo_set_*() static functions to bli_thrinfo.h
      and inserted usage of these functions within bli_thrinfo_init(), which
      previously was accessing thrinfo_t fields via the -> operator.
    - Renamed bli_partition_2x2() to bli_thread_partition_2x2().
    - Added an auto_factor field to the rntm_t struct in order to track
      whether automatic thread factorization was originally requested.
    - Added new test drivers in test/supmt that perform multithreaded sup
      tests, as well as appropriate octave/matlab scripts to plot the
      resulting output files.
    - Added additional language to docs/Multithreading.md to make it clear
      that specifying any BLIS_*_NT variable, even if it is set to 1, will
      be considered manual specification for the purposes of determining
      whether to auto-factorize via BLIS_NUM_THREADS.
    - Minor comment updates.

    Removed sorting on LDFLAGS in common.mk (#373).
    
    Details:
    - Removed a line of code in common.mk that passed LDFLAGS through the
      sort function. The purpose was not to sort the contents, but rather
      to remove duplicates. However, there is valid syntax in a string of
      linker flags that, when sorted, yields different/broken behavior.
      So I've removed the line in common.mk that sorts LDFLAGS. Also, for
      future use, I've added a new function, rm-dupls, that removes
      duplicates without sorting. (This function was based on code from a
      stackoverflow thread that is linked to in the comments for that
      code.) Thanks to Isuru Fernando for reporting this issue (#373).

    Removed 'attic/windows' (to prevent confusion).
    
    Details:
    - Finally removed 'attic/windows' and its contents. This directory once
      contained "proto" Windows support for BLIS, but we've since moved on
      to (thanks to Isuru Fernando) providing Windows DLL support via
      AppVeyor's build artifacts. Furthermore, since 'windows' was the only
      subdirectory within 'attic', the directory path would show up in
      GitHub's listing at https://github.com/flame/blis, which probably led
      to someone being confused about how BLIS provides Windows support. I
      assume (but don't know for sure) that nobody is using these files, so
      this is admittedly a case of shoot first and ask questions later.

    Fixed bugs in cblas_sdsdot(), sdsdot_().
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in sdsdot_sub() that redundantly added the "alpha" scalar,
      named 'sb'. This value was already being added by the underlying
      sdsdot_() function. Thus, we no longer add 'sb' within sdsdot_sub().
      Thanks to Simon Lukas Märtens for reporting this bug via #367.
    - Fixed a second bug in order of typecasting intermediate products in
      sdsdot_(). Previously, the "alpha" scalar was being added after the
      "outer" typecast to float. However, the operation is supposed to first
      add the dot product to the (promoted) scalar and THEN downcast the sum
      to float. Thanks to Devin Matthews for catching this bug.

    Updates and fixes to power9 subconfig.
    
    Details:
    - Register s,c,z reference gemm and trsm ukernels that assume elements
      of B have been broadcast.
    - Added prototypes for level-3 ukernels that assume elements of B have
      been broadcast. Also added prototype for an spackm function that
      employs a duplication/broadcast factor of 4.
    - Register virtual gemmtrsm ukernels that work with broadcasting of B.
    - Disable right-side hemm, symm, trmm, and trmm3 in bli_family_power9.h.
    - Thanks to Nicholai Tukanov for providing these updates.

    Added missing bli_l3_sup_thread_decorator() symbol.
    
    Details:
    - Defined dummy versions of bli_l3_sup_thread_decorator() for Openmp
      and pthreads so that those builds don't fail when performing shared
      library linking (especially for Windows DLLs via AppVeyor). For now,
      these dummy implementations of bli_l3_sup_thread_decorator() are
      merely carbon-copies of the implementation provided for single-
      threaded execution (ie: the one found in bli_l3_sup_decor_single.c).
      Thus, an OpenMP or pthreads build will be able to use the gemmsup
      code (including the new selective packing functionality), as it did
      before 39fa7136, even though it will not actually employ any
      multithreaded parallelism.

commit 39fa7136f4a4e55ccd9796fb79ad5f121b872ad9
Author: Field G. Van Zee <field@cs.utexas.edu>
Date:   Fri Nov 29 15:27:07 2019 -0600

    Added support for selective packing to gemmsup.
    
    Details:
    - Implemented optional packing for A or B (or both) within the sup
      framework (which currently only supports gemm). The request for
      packing either matrix A or matrix B can be made via setting
      environment variables BLIS_PACK_A or BLIS_PACK_B (to any
      non-zero value; if set, zero means "disable packing"). It can also
      be made globally at runtime via bli_pack_set_pack_a() and
      bli_pack_set_pack_b() or with individual rntm_t objects via
      bli_rntm_set_pack_a() and bli_rntm_set_pack_b() if using the expert
      interface of either the BLIS typed or object APIs. (If using the
      BLAS API, environment variables are the only way to communicate the
      packing request.)
    - One caveat (for now) with the current implementation of selective
      packing is that any blocksize extension registered in the _cntx_init
      function (such as is currently used by haswell and zen subconfigs)
      will be ignored if the affected matrix is packed. The reason is
      simply that I didn't get around to implementing the necessary logic
      to pack a larger edge-case micropanel, though this is entirely
      possible and should be done in the future.
    - Spun off the variant-choosing portion of bli_gemmsup_ref() into
      bli_gemmsup_int(), in bli_l3_sup_int.c.
    - Added new files, bli_l3_sup_packm_a.c, bli_l3_sup_packm_b.c, along
      with corresponding headers, in which higher-level packm-related
      functions are defined for use within the sup framework. The actual
      packm variant code resides in bli_l3_sup_packm_var.c.
    - Pass the following new parameters into var1n and var2m: packa, packb
      bool_t's, pointer to a rntm_t, pointer to a cntl_t (which is for now
      always NULL), and pointer to a thrinfo_t* (which for nowis the address
      of the global single-threaded packm thread control node).
    - Added panel strides ps_a and ps_b to the auxinfo_t structure so that
      the millikernel can query the panel stride of the packed matrix and
      step through it accordingly. If the matrix isn't packed, the panel
      stride of interest for the given millikernel will be set to the
      appropriate value so that the mkernel may step through the unpacked
      matrix as it normally would.
    - Modified the rv_6x8m and rv_6x8n millikernels to read the appropriate
      panel strides (ps_a and ps_b, respectively) instead of computing them
      on the fly.
    - Spun off the environment variable getting and setting functions into
      a new file, bli_env.c (with a corresponding prototype header). These
      functions are now used by the threading infrastructure (e.g.
      BLIS_NUM_THREADS, BLIS_JC_NT, etc.) as well as the selective packing
      infrastructure (e.g. BLIS_PACK_A, BLIS_PACK_B).
    - Added a static initializer for mem_t objects, BLIS_MEM_INITIALIZER.
    - Added a static initializer for pblk_t objects, BLIS_PBLK_INITIALIZER,
      for use within the definition of BLIS_MEM_INITIALIZER.
    - Moved the global_rntm object to bli_rntm.c and extern it where needed.
      This means that the function bli_thread_init_rntm() was renamed to
      bli_rntm_init_from_global() and relocated accordingly.
    - Added a new bli_pack.c function, which serves as the home for
      functions that manage the pack_a and pack_b fields of the global
      rntm_t, including from environment variables, just as we have
      functions to manage the threading fields of the global rntm_t in
      bli_thread.c.
    - Reorganized naming for files in frame/thread, which mostly involved
      spinning off the bli_l3_thread_decorator() functions into their own
      files. This change makes more sense when considering the further
      addition of bli_l3_sup_thread_decorator() functions (for now limited
      only to the single-threaded form found in the  _single.c file).
    - Explicitly initialize the reference sup handlers in both
      bli_cntx_init_haswell.c and bli_cntx_init_zen.c so that it's more
      obvious how to customize to a different handler, if desired.
    - Removed various snippets of disabled code.
    - Various comment updates.

    Fixed blastest failure for 'generic' subconfig.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a subtle and complicated bug that only manifested via the BLAS
      test drivers in the generic subconfiguration, and possibly any other
      subconfiguration that did not register complex-domain gemm ukernels,
      or registered ONLY real-domain ukernels as row-preferential. This is
      a long story, but it boils down to an exception to the "transpose the
      operation to bring storage of C into agreement with ukernel pref"
      optimization in bli_hemm_front.c and bli_symm_front.c sabotaging the
      proper functioning of the 1m method, but only when the imaginary
      component of beta is zero. See the comments in issue #342 for more
      details. Thanks to Dave Love for identifying the commit in which this
      bug was introduced, and other feedback related to this bug.

    Fixed obscure bug in bli_acquire_mpart_[mn]dim().
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in bli_acquire_mpart_mdim(), bli_acquire_mpart_ndim(),
      and bli_acquire_mpart_mndim() that allowed the use of a blocksize b
      that is too large given the current row/column index (i.e., the i/j
      argument) and the size of the dimension being partitioned (i.e., the
      m/n argument). This bug only affected backwards partitioning/motion
      through the dimension and was the result of a misplaced conditional
      check-and-redirect to the backwards code path. It should be noted
      that this bug was discovered not because it manifested the way it
      could (thanks to the callers in BLIS making sure to always pass in
      the "correct" blocksize b), but could have manifested if the
      functions were used by 3rd party callers. Thanks to Minh Quan Ho for
      reporting the bug via issue #363.

    Details:
    - Fixed a copy-paste bug in the new bli_spackm_6xk_bb4_ref() that
      manifested as failures in single-precision real level-3 operations.
      Also replaced the duplication factor constants with a const-qualifed
      varialbe, dfac, so that this won't happen again.
    - Changed NC for single-precision real from 4080 to 8160 so that the
      packed matrix B will have the same byte footprint in both single
      and double real.

    Various fixes to support packing duplication in B.
    
    Details:
    - Added cpp macros to trmm and trmm3 front-ends to optionally force
      those operations to be cast so the structured matrix is on the left.
      symm and hemm already had such macros, but these too were renamed so
      that the macros were individual to the operation. We now have four
      such macros:
        #define BLIS_DISABLE_HEMM_RIGHT
        #define BLIS_DISABLE_SYMM_RIGHT
        #define BLIS_DISABLE_TRMM_RIGHT
        #define BLIS_DISABLE_TRMM3_RIGHT
      Also, updated the comments in the symm and hemm front-ends related to
      the first two macro guards, and added corresponding comments to the
      trmm and trmm3 front-ends for the latter two guards. (They all
      functionally do the same thing, just for their specific operations.)
      Thanks to Jeff Hammond for reporting the bugs that led me to this
      change (via #359).
    - Updated config/old/haswellbb subconfiguration (used to debug issues
      related to duplicating B during packing) to register: a packing
      kernel for single-precision real; gemmbb ukernels for s, c, and z;
      trsmbb ukernels for s, c, and z; gemmtrsmbb virtual ukrnels for s, c
      and z; and to use non-default cache and register blocksizes for s, c,
      and z datatypes. Also declared prototypes for all of the gemmbb,
      trsmbb, and gemmtrsmbb ukernel functions within the
      bli_cntx_init_haswellbb() function. This should, once applied to the
      power9 configuration, fix the remaining issues in #359.
    - Defined bli_spackm_6xk_bb4_ref(), which packs single reals with a
      duplication factor of 4. This function is defined in the same file as
      bli_dpackm_6xk_bb2_ref() (bli_packm_cxk_bb_ref.c).

      for the unused variable 'f' in blastest/f2c/lread.c. (Hopefully)

    Fixed failing testsuite gemmtrsm_ukr for power9.
    
    Details:
    - Added code that fixes false failures in the gemmtrsm_ukr module of the
      testsuite. The tests were failing because the computation (bli_gemv())
      that performs the numerical check was not able to properly travserse
      the matrix operands bx1 and b11 that are views into the micropanel of
      B, which has duplicated/broadcast elements under the power9 subconfig.
      (For example, a micropanel of B with duplication factor of 2 needs to
      use a column stride of 2; previously, the column stride was being
      interpreted as 1.)
    - Defined separate bli_obj_set_row_stride() and bli_obj_set_col_stride()
      static functions in bli_obj_macro_defs.h. (Previously, only the
      function bli_obj_set_strides() was defined. Amazing to think that we
      got this far without these former functions.)
    - Updated/expounded upon comments.

    Fixed latent testsuite ukr module bugs for power9.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a latent bug in the testsuite ukernel modules (gemm, trsm, and
      gemmtrsm) that only manifested once we began running with parameters
      that mimic those of power9. The problem was rooted in the way those
      modules were creating objects (and thus allocating memory) for the
      micropanel operands to the microkernel being tested. Since power9
      duplicates/broadcasts elements of B in memory, we needed an easy way
      of asking for more than one storage element per logical element in
      the matrix. I incorrectly expressed this as:
    
        bli_obj_create( datatype, k, n, ldbp, 1, &bp );
    
      The problem here is that bli_obj_create() is exceedingly efficient
      at calculating the size it passes to malloc() and doesn't allocate a
      full leading dimension's worth of elements for the last column (or
      row, in this example). This would normally not bother anyone since
      you're not supposed to access that memory anyway. But here, my
      attempted "hack" for getting extra elements was insufficient, and
      needed to be changed to:
    
        bli_obj_create( datatype, k, ldbp, ldbp, 1, &bp );
    
      That is, the extra elements needed to be baked into the dimensions of
      the matrix object in order to have the intended effect on the number
      of elements actually allocated. Thanks to Jeff Hammond for reporting
      this bug.
    - Fixed a typically harmless memory leak in the aforementioned test
      modules (the objects for the packed micropanels were not being freed).
    - Updated/expanded a common comment across all three ukr test modules.

    POWER9 DGEMM  (#355)
    
    Implemented and registered power9 dgemm ukernel.
    
    Details:
    - Implemented 12x6 dgemm microkernel for power9. This microkernel
      assumes that elements of B have been duplicated/broadcast during the
      packing step. The microkernel uses a column orientation for its
      microtile vector registers and thus implements column storage and
      general stride IO cases. (A row storage IO case via in-register
      transposition may be added at a future date.) It should be noted that
      we recommend using this microkernel with gcc and *not* xlc, as issues
      with the latter cropped up during development, including but not
      limited to slightly incompatible vector register mnemonics in the GNU
      extended inline assembly clobber list.

    Call bli_syrk_small() before error checking.
    
    Details:
    - In bli_syrk_front(), moved the conditional call to bli_syrk_check()
      (if error checking is enabled) and the conditional scaling of C by
      beta (if alpha is zero) so that they occur after, instead of before,
      the call to bli_syrk_small(). This sequencing now matches that of
      bli_gemm_small() in bli_gemm_front() and bli_trsm_small() in
      bli_trsm_front().

    When manual config is blacklisted, output error.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed and adjusted the logic in configure so that a more informative
      error message is output when a user runs './configure ... <conf>' and
      <conf> is present in the configuration blacklist. Previously, this
      particular set of conditions would result in the message:
    
        'user-specified configuration '' is NOT registered!
    
      That is, the error message mis-identified the targeted configuration
      as the empty string, and (more importantly) mis-identifies the
      problem. Thanks to Tze Meng Low for reporting this issue.
    - Fixed a nearby error messages somewhat unrelated to the issue above.
      Specifically, the wrong string was being printed when the error
      message was identifying an auto-detected configuration that did not
      appear to be registered.

    Changed -march=znver2 to =znver1 for clang on zen2.
    
    Details:
    - In config/zen2/make_defs.mk, changed the -march= flag so that
      -march=znver1 is used instead of -march=znver2 when CC_VENDOR is
      clang. (The gcc branch attempts to differentiate between various
      versions, but the equivalent version cutoffs for clang are not
      yet known by us, so we have to use a single flag for all versions
      of clang. Hopefully -march=znver1 is new enough. If not, we'll
      fall back to -march=bdver4 -mno-fma4 -mno-tbm -mno-xop -mno-lwp.)
      This issue was discovered thanks to AppVeyor.

    Code review + tweaks to AMD's AOCL 2.0 PR (#349).
    
    Details:
    - NOTE: This is a merge commit of 'master' of git://github.com/amd/blis
      into 'amd-master' of flame/blis.
    - Fixed a bug in the downstream value of BLIS_NUM_ARCHS, which was
      inadvertantly not incremented when the Zen2 subconfiguration was
      added.
    - In bli_gemm_front(), added a missing conditional constraint around the
      call to bli_gemm_small() that ensures that the computation precision
      of C matches the storage precision of C.
    - In bli_syrk_front(), reorganized and relocated the notrans/trans logic
      that existed around the call to bli_syrk_small() into bli_syrk_small()
      to minimize the calling code footprint and also to bring that code
      into stylistic harmony with similar code in bli_gemm_front() and
      bli_trsm_front(). Also, replaced direct accessing of obj_t fields with
      proper accessor static functions (e.g. 'a->dim[0]' becomes
      'bli_obj_length( a )').
    - Added #ifdef BLIS_ENABLE_SMALL_MATRIX guard around prototypes for
      bli_gemm_small(), bli_syrk_small(), and bli_trsm_small(). This is
      strictly speaking unnecessary, but it serves as a useful visual cue to
      those who may be reading the files.
    - Removed cpp macro-protected small matrix debugging code from
      bli_trsm_front.c.
    - Added a GCC_OT_9_1_0 variable to build/config.mk.in to facilitate gcc
      version check for availability of -march=znver2, and added appropriate
      support to configure script.
    - Cleanups to compiler flags common to recent AMD microarchitectures in
      config/zen/amd_config.mk, including: removal of -march=znver1 et al.
      from CKVECFLAGS (since the -march flag is added within make_defs.mk);
      setting CRVECFLAGS similarly to CKVECFLAGS.
    - Cleanups to config/zen/bli_cntx_init_zen.c.
    - Cleanups, added comments to config/zen/make_defs.mk.
    - Cleanups to config/zen2/make_defs.mk, including making use of newly-
      added GCC_OT_9_1_0 and existing GCC_OT_6_1_0 to choose the correct
      set of compiler flags based on the version of gcc being used.
    - Reverted downstream changes to test/test_gemm.c.
    - Various whitespace/comment changes.

    Added support for pre-broadcast when packing B.
    
    Details:
    - Added support for being able to duplicate (broadcast) elements in
      memory when packing matrix B (ie: the left-hand operand) in level-3
      operations. This turns out advantageous for some architectures that
      can afford the cost of the extra bandwidth and somehow benefit from
      the pre-broadcast elements (and thus being able to avoid using
      broadcast-style load instructions on micro-rows of B in the gemm
      microkernel).
    - Support optionally disabling right-side hemm and symm. If this occurs,
      hemm_r is implemented in terms of hemm_l (and symm_r in terms of
      symm_l). This is needed when broadcasting during packing because the
      alternative--supporting the broadcast of B while also allowing matrix
      B to be Hermitian/symmetric--would be an absolute mess.
    - Support alignment factors for packed blocks of A, B, and C separately
      (as well as for general-purpose buffers). In addition, we support
      byte offsets from those alignment values (which is different from
      aligning by align+offset bytes to begin with). The default alignment
      values are BLIS_PAGE_SIZE in all four cases, with the offset values
      defaulting to zero.
    - Pass pack_t schema into bli_?packm_cxk() so that it can be then passed
      into the packm kernel, where it will be needed by packm kernels that
      perform broadcasts of B, since the idea is that we *only* want to
      broadcast when packing micropanels of B and not A.
    - Added definition for variadic bli_cntx_set_l3_vir_ukrs(), which can be
      used to set custom virtual level-3 microkernels in the cntx_t, which
      would typically be done in the bli_cntx_init_*() function defined in
      the subconfiguration of interest.
    - Added a "broadcast B" kernel function for use with NP/NR = 12/6,
      defined in in ref_kernels/1m/bli_packm_cxk_bb_ref.c.
    - Added a gemm, gemmtrsm, and trsm "broadcast B" reference kernels
      defined in ref_kernels/3/bb. (These kernels have been tested with
      double real with NP/NR = 12/6.)
    - Added #ifndef ... #endif guards around several macro constants defined
      in frame/include/bli_kernel_macro_defs.h.
    - Defined a few "broadcast B" static functions in
      frame/include/level0/bb for use by "broadcast B"-style packm reference
      kernels. For now, only the real domain kernels are tested and fully
      defined.
    - Output the alignment and offset values for packed blocks of A and B
      in the testsuite's "BLIS configuration info" section.
    - Comment updates to various files.
    - Bumped so_version to 3.0.0.

      test/sup/test_gemm.c that only manifested when the problem size
      increment was equal to 1.
    - Disabled the building of rrc, rcr, rcc, crr, crc, and ccr storage
      combinations for blissup drivers in test/sup. This helps make the
      building of drivers complete sooner.

    Changed test/sup alpha to 1; test libxsmm+netlib.
    
    Details:
    - Changed the value of alpha to 1.0 in test/sup/test_gemm.c. This is
      needed because libxsmm currently only optimizes gemm operations where
      alpha is unit (and beta is unit or zero).
    - Adjusted the test/sup/Makefile to test libxsmm with netlib BLAS as its
      fallback library. This is the library that will be called the
      problem dimensions are deemed too large, or any other criteria for
      optimization are not met. (This was done not because it is realistic,
      but rather so that it would be very clear when libxsmm ceased handling
      gemm calls internally when the data are graphed.)

    Use libxsmm API in test/sup; add missing -ldl.
    
    Details:
    - Switch the driver source in test/sup so that libxsmm_?gemm() is called
      instead of ?gemm_() when compiling for / linking against libxsmm.
      libxsmm's documentation isn't clear on whether it is even *trying* to
      provide BLAS API compatibility, and I got tired of trying to figure it
      out.
    - Added missing -ldl in LDFLAGS when linking against libxsmm.

    Added libxsmm support to test/sup drivers.
    
    Details:
    - Modified test/sup/Makefile to build drivers that test the performance
      of skinny/small problems via libxsmm.
    - Modified test/sup/runme.sh to run aforementioned drivers.
    - Modified test/sup/test_gemm.c so that problem sizes are tested in
      reverse order (from largest to smallest). This can help avoid certain
      situations where the CPU frequency does not immediately throttle up
      to its maximum. Thanks to Robert van de Geijn for recommending this
      fix.

    Pacify 'restrict' warning in gemmtrsm4m1 ref ukr.
    
    Details:
    - Previously, some versions of gcc would complain that the same
      pointer, one_r, is being passed in for both alpha and beta in the
      fourth call to the real gemm ukernel in bli_gemmtrsm4m1_ref.c. This
      is understandable since the compiler knows that the real gemm ukernel
      qualifies all of its floating-point arguments (including alpha and
      beta) with restrict. A small hack has been inserted into the file
      that defines a new variable to store the value 1.0, which is now used
      in lieu of one_r for beta in the fourth call to the real gemm ukernel,
      which should pacify the compiler now. Thanks to Dave Love for
      reporting this issue (#328) and for Devin Matthews for offering his
      'restrict' expertise.

    Add -march support for specific gcc version ranges.
    
    Details:
    - Added logic to configure that checks the version of the compiler
      against known version ranges that could cause problems later in the
      build process. For example, versions of gcc older than 4.9.0 use
      different -march labels than version 4.9.0 or later
      ('-march=corei7-avx' vs '-march=sandybridge', respectively).
      Similarly, before 6.1, compilation on Zen was possible, but you
      need to start with -march=bdver4 and then disable instruction sets
      that were discarded during the transition from Excavator to Zen. So
      now, configure substitutes 'yes'/'no' values into anchors in
      config.mk.in, which sets various make variables (e.g. GCC_OT_4_9_0),
      which can be accessed and branched upon by the various
      configurations' make_defs.mk files when setting their compiler flags.
    - Updated config/haswell/make_defs.mk to branch on GCC_OT_4_9_0.
    - Updated config/sandybridge/make_defs.mk to branch on GCC_OT_4_9_0.
    - Updated config/zen/make_defs.mk to branch on GCC_OT_6_1_0.

      forms a long time ago. (The older flags were clearly working, even
      though they are no longer documented in the gcc man page.)

    Fixed thrinfo_t printing bug for small problems.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in bli_l3_thrinfo_print_gemm_paths() and
      bli_l3_thrinfo_print_trsm_paths(), defined in bli_l3_thrinfo.c,
      whereby subnodes of the thrinfo_t tree are "dereferenced" near the
      beginning of the functions, which may lead to segfaults in certain
      situations where the thread tree was not fully formed because the
      matrix problem was too small for the level of parallelism specified.
      (That is, too small because some problems were assigned no work due
      to the smallest units in the m and n dimensions being defined by the
      register blocksizes mr and nr.) The fix requires several nested levels
      of if statements, and this is one of those few instances where use of
      goto statements results in (mostly) prettier code, especially in the
      case of _gemm_paths(). And while it wasn't necessary, I ported this
      goto usage to the loop body that prints the thrinfo_t work_id and
      comm_id values for each thread. Thanks to Nicholai Tukanov for helping
      to find this bug.

    Added sup performance graphs/document to 'docs'.
    
    Details:
    - Added a new markdown document, docs/PerformanceSmall.md, which
      publishes new performance graphs for Kaby Lake and Epyc showcasing
      the new BLIS sup (small/skinny/unpacked) framework logic and kernels.
      For now, only single-threaded dgemm performance is shown.
    - Reorganized graphs in docs/graphs into docs/graphs/large, with new
      graphs being placed in docs/graphs/sup.
    - Updates to scripts in test/sup/octave, mostly to allow decent output
      in both GNU octave and Matlab.
    - Updated README.md to mention and refer to the new PerformanceSmall.md
      document.

    Increased MT sup threshold for double to 201.
    
    Details:
    - Fine-tuned the double-precision real MT threshold (which controls
      whether the sup implementation kicks for smaller m dimension values)
      from 180 to 201 for haswell and 180 to 256 for zen.
    - Updated octave scripts in test/sup/octave to include a seventh column
      to display performance for m = n = k.

    Inadvertantly hidden xerbla_() in blastest (#313).
    
    Details:
    - Attempted a fix to issue #313, which reports that when building only
      a shared library (ie: static library build is disabled), running the
      BLAS test drivers can fail because those drivers provide their own
      local version of xerbla_() as a clever (albeit still rather hackish)
      way of checking the error codes that result from the individual tests.
      This local xerbla_() function is never found at link-time because the
      BLAS test drivers' Makefile imports BLIS compilation flags via the
      get-user-cflags-for() function, which currently conveys the
      -fvisibility=hidden flag, which hides symbols unless they are
      explicitly annotated for export. The -fvisibility=hidden flag was
      only ever intended for use when building BLIS (not for applications),
      and so the attempted solution here is to omit the symbol export
      flag(s) from get-user-cflags-for() by storing the symbol export
      flag(s) to a new BULID_SYMFLAGS variable instead of appending it
      to the subconfigurations' CMISCFLAGS variable (which is returned by
      every get-*-cflags-for() function). Thanks to M. Zhou for reporting
      this issue and also to Isuru Fernando for suggesting the fix.
    - Renamed BUILD_FLAGS to BUILD_CPPFLAGS to harmonize with the newly
      created BUILD_SYMFLAGS.
    - Fixed typo in entry for --export-shared flag in 'configure --help'
      text.

    Increased MT sup threshold for double to 180.
    
    Details:
    - Increased the double-precision real MT threshold (which controls
      whether the sup implementation kicks for smaller m dimension values)
      from 80 to 180, and this change was made for both haswell and zen
      subconfigurations. This is less about the m dimension in particular
      and more about facilitating a smoother performance transition when
      m = n = k.

      to a different copy of libblis.
    - Very minor changes to build/gen-make-frags/gen-make-frag.sh.
    - Whitespace and inconsequential quoting change to configure.
    - Moved top-level 'windows' directory into a new 'attic' directory.

    Define _POSIX_C_SOURCE in bli_system.h.
    
    Details:
    - Added
        #ifndef _POSIX_C_SOURCE
        #define _POSIX_C_SOURCE 200809L
        #endif
      to bli_system.h so that an application that uses BLIS (specifically,
      an application that #includes blis.h) does not need to remember to
      #define the macro itself (either on the command line or in the code
      that includes blis.h) in order to activate things like the pthreads.
      Thanks to Christos Psarras for reporting this issue and suggesting
      this fix.
    - Commented out #include <sys/time.h> in bli_system.h, since I don't
      think this header is used/needed anymore.

    Minor bugfixes in sup dgemm implementation.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed an obscure but in the bli_dgemmsup_rv_haswell_asm_5x8n() kernel
      that only affected the beta == 0, column-storage output case. Thanks
      to the BLAS test drivers for catching this bug.
    - Previously, bli_gemmsup_ref_var1n() and _var2m() were returning if
      k = 0, when the correct action would be to scale by beta (and then
      return). Thanks to the BLAS test drivers to catching this bug.
    - Changed the sup threshold behavior such that the sup implementation
      only kicks in if a matrix dimension is strictly less than (rather than
      less than or equal to) the threshold in question.
    - Initialize all thresholds to zero (instead of 10) by default in
      ref_kernels/bli_cntx_ref.c. This, combined with the above change to
      threshold testing means that calls to BLIS or BLAS with one or more
      matrix dimensions of zero will no longer trigger the sup
      implementation.
    - Added disabled debugging output to frame/3/bli_l3_sup.c (for future
      use, perhaps).

    Ceased use of BLIS_ENABLE_SUP_MR/NR_EXT macros.
    
    Details:
    - Removed already limited use of the BLIS_ENABLE_SUP_MR_EXT and
      BLIS_ENABLE_SUP_NR_EXT macros in bli_gemmsup_ref_var1n() and
      bli_gemmsup_ref_var2m(). Their purpose was merely to avoid a long
      conditional that would determine whether to allow the last iteration
      to be merged with the second-to-last iteration. Functionally, the
      macros were not needed, and they ended up causing problems when
      building configuration families such as intel64 and x86_64.

    Fixed typo in --disable-sup-handling macro guard.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed an incorrectly-named macro guard that is intended to allow
      disabling of the sup framework via the configure option
      --disable-sup-handling. In this case, the preprocessor macro,
      BLIS_DISABLE_SUP_HANDLING, was still named by its name from an older
      uncommitted version of the code (BLIS_DISABLE_SM_HANDLING).

    Implemented gemm on skinny/unpacked matrices.
    
    Details:
    - Implemented a new sub-framework within BLIS to support the management
      of code and kernels that specifically target matrix problems for which
      at least one dimension is deemed to be small, which can result in long
      and skinny matrix operands that are ill-suited for the conventional
      level-3 implementations in BLIS. The new framework tackles the problem
      in two ways. First the stripped-down algorithmic loops forgo the
      packing that is famously performed in the classic code path. That is,
      the computation is performed by a new family of kernels tailored
      specifically for operating on the source matrices as-is (unpacked).
      Second, these new kernels will typically (and in the case of haswell
      and zen, do in fact) include separate assembly sub-kernels for
      handling of edge cases, which helps smooth performance when performing
      problems whose m and n dimension are not naturally multiples of the
      register blocksizes. In a reference to the sub-framework's purpose of
      supporting skinny/unpacked level-3 operations, the "sup" operation
      suffix (e.g. gemmsup) is typically used to denote a separate namespace
      for related code and kernels. NOTE: Since the sup framework does not
      perform any packing, it targets row- and column-stored matrices A, B,
      and C. For now, if any matrix has non-unit strides in both dimensions,
      the problem is computed by the conventional implementation.
    - Implemented the default sup handler as a front-end to two variants.
      bli_gemmsup_ref_var2() provides a block-panel variant (in which the
      2nd loop around the microkernel iterates over n and the 1st loop
      iterates over m), while bli_gemmsup_ref_var1() provides a panel-block
      variant (2nd loop over m and 1st loop over n). However, these variants
      are not used by default and provided for reference only. Instead, the
      default sup handler calls _var2m() and _var1n(), which are similar
      to _var2() and _var1(), respectively, except that they defer to the
      sup kernel itself to iterate over the m and n dimension, respectively.
      In other words, these variants rely not on microkernels, but on
      so-called "millikernels" that iterate along m and k, or n and k.
      The benefit of using millikernels is a reduction of function call
      and related (local integer typecast) overhead as well as the ability
      for the kernel to know which micropanel (A or B) will change during
      the next iteration of the 1st loop, which allows it to focus its
      prefetching on that micropanel. (In _var2m()'s millikernel, the upanel
      of A changes while the same upanel of B is reused. In _var1n()'s, the
      upanel of B changes while the upanel of A is reused.)
    - Added a new configure option, --[en|dis]able-sup-handling, which is
      enabled by default. However, the default thresholds at which the
      default sup handler is activated are set to zero for each of the m, n,
      and k dimensions, which effectively disables the implementation. (The
      default sup handler only accepts the problem if at least one dimension
      is smaller than or equal to its corresponding threshold. If all
      dimensions are larger than their thresholds, the problem is rejected
      by the sup front-end and control is passed back to the conventional
      implementation, which proceeds normally.)
    - Added support to the cntx_t structure to track new fields related to
      the sup framework, most notably:
      - sup thresholds: the thresholds at which the sup handler is called.
      - sup handlers: the address of the function to call to implement
        the level-3 skinny/unpacked matrix implementation.
      - sup blocksizes: the register and cache blocksizes used by the sup
        implementation (which may be the same or different from those used
        by the conventional packm-based approach).
      - sup kernels: the kernels that the handler will use in implementing
        the sup functionality.
      - sup kernel prefs: the IO preference of the sup kernels, which may
        differ from the preferences of the conventional gemm microkernels'
        IO preferences.
    - Added a bool_t to the rntm_t structure that indicates whether sup
      handling should be enabled/disabled. This allows per-call control
      of whether the sup implementation is used, which is useful for test
      drivers that wish to switch between the conventional and sup codes
      without having to link to different copies of BLIS. The corresponding
      accessor functions for this new bool_t are defined in bli_rntm.h.
    - Implemented several row-preferential gemmsup kernels in a new
      directory, kernels/haswell/3/sup. These kernels include two general
      implementation types--'rd' and 'rv'--for the 6x8 base shape, with
      two specialized millikernels that embed the 1st loop within the kernel
      itself.
    - Added ref_kernels/3/bli_gemmsup_ref.c, which provides reference
      gemmsup microkernels. NOTE: These microkernels, unlike the current
      crop of conventional (pack-based) microkernels, do not use constant
      loop bounds. Additionally, their inner loop iterates over the k
      dimension.
    - Defined new typedef enums:
      - stor3_t: captures the effective storage combination of the level-3
        problem. Valid values are BLIS_RRR, BLIS_RRC, BLIS_RCR, etc. A
        special value of BLIS_XXX is used to denote an arbitrary combination
        which, in practice, means that at least one of the operands is
        stored according to general stride.
      - threshid_t: captures each of the three dimension thresholds.
    - Changed bli_adjust_strides() in bli_obj.c so that bli_obj_create()
      can be passed "-1, -1" as a lazy request for row storage. (Note that
      "0, 0" is still accepted as a lazy request for column storage.)
    - Added support for various instructions to bli_x86_asm_macros.h,
      including imul, vhaddps/pd, and other instructions related to integer
      vectors.
    - Disabled the older small matrix handling code inserted by AMD in
      bli_gemm_front.c, since the sup framework introduced in this commit
      is intended to provide a more generalized solution.
    - Added test/sup directory, which contains standalone performance test
      drivers, a Makefile, a runme.sh script, and an 'octave' directory
      containing scripts compatible with GNU Octave. (They also may work
      with matlab, but if not, they are probably close to working.)
    - Reinterpret the storage combination string (sc_str) in the various
      level-3 testsuite modules (e.g. src/test_gemm.c) so that the order
      of each matrix storage char is "cab" rather than "abc".
    - Comment updates in level-3 BLAS API wrappers in frame/compat.

    Support row storage in Eigen gemm test/3 driver.
    
    Details:
    - Added preprocessor branches to test/3/test_gemm.c to explicitly
      support row-stored matrices. Column-stored matrices are also still
      supported (and is the default for now). (This is mainly residual work
      leftover from initial integration of Eigen into the test drivers, so
      if we ever want to test Eigen with row-stored matrices, the code will
      be ready to use, even if it is not yet integrated into the Makefile
      in test/3.)

    GNU-like handling of installation prefix et al.
    
    Details:
    - Changed the default installation prefix from $HOME/lib to /usr/local.
    - Modified the way configure internally handles the prefix, libdir,
      includedir, and sharedir (and also added an --exec-prefix option).
      The defaults to these variables are set as follows:
        prefix:      /usr/local
        exec_prefix: ${prefix}
        libdir:      ${exec_prefix}/lib
        includedir:  ${prefix}/include
        sharedir:    ${prefix}/share
      The key change, aside from the addition of exec_prefix and its use to
      define the default to libdir, is that the variables are substituted
      into config.mk with quoting that delays evaluation, meaning the
      substituted values may contain unevaluated references to other
      variables (namely, ${prefix} and ${exec_prefix}). This more closely
      follows GNU conventions, including those used by GNU autoconf, and
      also allows make to override any one of the variables *after*
      configure has already been run (e.g. during 'make install').
    - Updates to build/config.mk.in pursuant to above changes.
    - Updates to output of 'configure --help' pursuant to above changes.
    - Updated docs/BuildSystem.md to reflect the new default installation
      prefix, as well as mention EXECPREFIX and SHAREDIR.
    - Changed the definitions of the UNINSTALL_OLD_* variables in the
      top-level Makefile to use $(wildcard ...) instead of 'find'. This
      was motivated by the new way of handling prefix and friends, which
      leads to the 'find' command being run on /usr/local (by default),
      which can take a while almost never yielding any benefit (since the
      user will very rarely use the uninstall-old targets).
    - Removed periods from the end of descriptive output statements (i.e.,
      non-verbose output) since those statements often end with file or
      directory paths, which get confusing to read when puctuated by a
      period.
    - Trival change to 'make showconfig' output.
    - Removed my name from 'configure --help'. (Many have contributed to it
      over the years.)
    - In configure script, changed the default state of threading_model
      variable from 'no' to 'off' to match that of debug_type, where there
      are similarly more than two valid states. ('no' is still accepted
      if given via the --enable-debug= option, though it will be
      standardized to 'off' prior to config.mk being written out.)
    - Minor variable name change in flatten-headers.py that was intended for
      32812ff.
    - CREDITS file update.

    Fix for single rank crash with HPL application. When computing offset of C buffer, as integer variables are used for a row and column index, the intermediate result value overflows and a negative value gets added to the buffer, when the negative value is too large it would index the buffer out of the range resulting in segmentation fault. Although the crash is a result of dgemm kernel, added similar code in sgemm kernel also.

    Minor bugfix to flatten-headers.py.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a minor bug in flatten-headers.py whereby the script, upon
      encountering a #include directive for the root header file, would
      erroneously recurse and inline the conents of that root header.
      The script has been modified to avoid recursion into any headers
      that share the same name as the root-level header that was passed
      into the script. (Note: this bug didn't actually manifest in BLIS,
      so it's merely a precaution for usage of flatten-headers.py in other
      contexts.)

    Use void_fp for function pointers instead of void*.
    
    Change void*-typed function pointers to void_fp.
    - Updated all instances of void* variables that store function pointers
      to variables of a new type, void_fp. Originally, I wanted to define
      the type of void_fp as "void (*void_fp)( void )"--that is, a pointer
      to a function with no return value and no arguments. However, once
      I did this, I realized that gcc complains with incompatible pointer
      type (-Wincompatible-pointer-types) warnings every time any such a
      pointer is being assigned to its final, type-accurate function
      pointer type. That is, gcc will silently typecast a void* to
      another defined function pointer type (e.g. dscalv_ker_ft) during
      an assignment from the former to the latter, but the same statement
      will trigger a warning when typecasting from a void_fp type. I suspect
      an explicit typecast is needed in order to avoid the warning, which
      I'm not willing to insert at this time.
    - Added a typedef to bli_type_defs.h defining void_fp as void*, along
      with a commented-out version of the aborted definition described
      above. (Note that POSIX requires that void* and function pointers
      be interchangeable; it is the C standard that does not provide this
      guarantee.)
    - Comment updates to various _oapi.c files.

    Added Eigen results to performance graphs.
    
    Details:
    - Updated the Haswell, SkylakeX, and Epyc performance graphs in
      docs/graphs to report on Eigen implementations, where applicable.
      Specifically, Eigen implements all level-3 operations sequentially,
      however, of those operations it only provides multithreaded gemm.
      Thus, mt results for symm/hemm, syrk/herk, trmm, and trsm are
      omitted. Thanks to Sameer Agarwal for his help configuring and
      using Eigen.
    - Updated docs/Performance.md to note the new implementation tested.

    Link to Eigen BLAS for non-gemm drivers in test/3.
    
    Details:
    - Adjusted test/3/Makefile so that the test drivers are linked against
      Eigen's BLAS library for hemm, herk, trmm, and trsm. We have to do
      this since Eigen's headers don't define implementations to the
      standard BLAS APIs.
    - Simplified #included headers in hemm, herk, trmm, and trsm source
      driver files, since nothing specific to Eigen is needed at
      compile-time for those operations.

    Add more support for Eigen to drivers in test/3.
    
    Details:
    - Use compile-time implementations of Eigen in test_gemm.c via new
      EIGEN cpp macro, defined on command line. (Linking to Eigen's BLAS
      library is not necessary.) However, as of Eigen 3.3.7, Eigen only
      parallelizes the gemm operation and not hemm, herk, trmm, trsm, or
      any other level-3 operation.
    - Fixed a bug in trmm and trsm drivers whereby the wrong function
      (bli_does_trans()) was being called to determine whether the object
      for matrix A should be created for a left- or right-side case. This
      was corrected by changing the function to bli_is_left(), as is done
      in the hemm driver.
    - Added support for running Eigen test drivers from runme.sh.

    Allow disabling of BLAS prototypes at compile-time.
    
    Details:
    - Modified bli_blas.h so that:
      - By default, if the BLAS layer is enabled at configure-time, BLAS
        prototypes are also enabled within blis.h;
      - But if the user #defines BLIS_DISABLE_BLAS_DEFS prior to including
        blis.h, BLAS prototypes are skipped over entirely so that, for
        example, the application or some other header pulled in by the
        application may prototype the BLAS functions without causing any
        duplication.
    - Updated docs/BuildSystem.md to document the feature above, and
      related text.

    Format for input file:
    Each line defines a gemm problem with following parameters: m k n cs_a cs_b cs_c
    The operation always implemented is C = C - A*B and column-major format.
    When macro is disabled - it reverts back to original implementation.
    Usage: ./test_gemm_<mkl/blis/openblas>.x input.csv output.csv
    GEMM is called through BLAS interface
    For BLIS - the test application also prints either 'S' indicating small gemm routine or 'N' - conventional BLIS gemm
    for MKL/OpenBLAS - ignore this character

    Added Eigen support to test/3 Makefile, runme.sh.
    
    Details:
    - Added targets to test/3/Makefile that link against a BLAS library
      build by Eigen. It appears, however, that Eigen's BLAS library does
      not support multithreading. (It may be that multithreading is only
      available when using the native C++ APIs.)
    - Updated runme.sh with a few Eigen-related tweaks.
    - Minor tweaks to docs/Performance.md.

    Added docs/Performance.md and docs/graphs subdir.
    
    Details:
    - Added a new markdown document, docs/Performance.md, which reports
      performance of a representative set of level-3 operations across a
      variety of hardware architectures, comparing BLIS to OpenBLAS and a
      vendor library (MKL on Intel/AMD, ARMPL on ARM). Performance graphs,
      in pdf and png formats, reside in docs/graphs.
    - Updated README.md to link to new Performance.md document.
    - Minor updates to CREDITS, docs/Multithreading.md.
    - Minor updates to matlab scripts in test/3/matlab.

    - Adjusted the zen sub-configuration's cache blocksizes for float,
      scomplex, and dcomplex based on the existing values for double.
      (The previous values were taken directly from the haswell subconfig,
      which targets Intel Haswell/Broadwell/Skylake systems.)

    Details:
    - Replaced the existing --enable-export-all / --disable-export-all
      configure option with --export-shared=[public|all], with the 'public'
      instance of the latter corresponding to --disable-export-all and the
      'all' instance corresponding to --enable-export-all. Nothing else
      semantically about the option, or its default, has changed.

    Updates to docs/Multithreading.md.
    
    Details:
    - Made extra explicit the fact that: (a) multithreading in BLIS is
      disabled by default; and (b) even with multithreading enabled, the
      user must specify multithreading at runtime in order to observe
      parallelism. Thanks to M. Zhou for suggesting these clarifications
      in #292.
    - Also made explicit that only the environment variable and global
      runtime API methods are available when using the BLAS API. If the
      user wishes to use the local runtime API (specify multithreading on
      a per-call basis), one of the native BLIS APIs must be used.

    Support shared lib export of only public symbols.
    
    Details:
    - Introduced a new configure option, --enable-export-all, which will
      cause all shared library symbols to be exported by default, or,
      alternatively, --disable-export-all, which will cause all symbols to
      be hidden by default, with only those symbols that are annotated for
      visibility, via BLIS_EXPORT_BLIS (and BLIS_EXPORT_BLAS for BLAS
      symbols), to be exported. The default for this configure option is
      --disable-export-all. Thanks to Isuru Fernando for consulting on
      this commit.
    - Removed BLIS_EXPORT_BLIS annotations from frame/1m/bli_l1m_unb_var1.h,
      which was intended for 5a5f494.
    - Relocated BLIS_EXPORT-related cpp logic from bli_config.h.in to
      frame/include/bli_config_macro_defs.h.
    - Provided appropriate logic within common.mk to implement variable
      symbol visibility for gcc, clang, and icc (to the extend that each of
      these compilers allow).
    - Relocated --help text associated with debug option (-d) to configure
      slightly further down in the list.

    Removed export macros from all internal prototypes.
    
    Details:
    - After merging PR #303, at Isuru's request, I removed the use of
      BLIS_EXPORT_BLIS from all function prototypes *except* those that we
      potentially wish to be exported in shared/dynamic libraries. In other
      words, I removed the use of BLIS_EXPORT_BLIS from all prototypes of
      functions that can be considered private or for internal use only.
      This is likely the last big modification along the path towards
      implementing the functionality spelled out in issue #248. Thanks
      again to Isuru Fernando for his initial efforts of sprinkling the
      export macros throughout BLIS, which made removing them where
      necessary relatively painless. Also, I'd like to thank Tony Kelman,
      Nathaniel Smith, Ian Henriksen, Marat Dukhan, and Matthew Brett for
      participating in the initial discussion in issue #37 that was later
      summarized and restated in issue #248.

    Renamed test/3m4m to test/3.
    
    Details:
    - Renamed '3m4m' directory to '3', which captures the directory nicely
      since it builds test drivers to test level-3 operations.
    - These test drivers ceased to be used to test the 3m and 4m (or even
      1m) induced methods long ago, hence the name change.

    Overhauled test/3m4m Makefile and scripts.
    
    Details:
    - Rewrote much of Makefile to generate executables for single- and dual-
      socket multithreading as well as single-threaded. Each of the three
      can also use a different problem size range/increment, as is often
      appropriate when doubling/halving the number of threads.
    - Rewrote runme.sh script to flexibly execute as many threading
      parameter scenarios as is given in the input parameter string
      (currently set within the script itself). The string also encodes
      the maximum problem size for each threading scenario, which is used
      to identify the executable to run. Also improved the "progress" output
      of the script to reduce redundant info and improve readability in
      terminals that are not especially wide.
    - Minor updates to test_*.c source files.
    - Updated matlab scripts according to changes made to the Makefile,
      test drivers, and runme.sh script, and renamed 'plot_all.m' to
      'runme.m'.

    Updated level-3 BLAS to call object API directly.
    
    Details:
    - Updated the BLAS compatibility layer for level-3 operations so that
      the corresponding BLIS object API is called directly rather than first
      calling the typed BLIS API. The previous code based on the typed BLIS
      API calls is still available in a deactivated cpp macro branch, which
      may be re-activated by #defining BLIS_BLAS3_CALLS_TAPI. (This does not
      yet correspond to a configure option. If it seems like people might
      want to toggle this behavior more regularly, a configure option can be
      added in the future.)
    - Updated the BLIS typed API to statically "pre-initialize" objects via
      new initializor macros. Initialization is then finished via calls to
      static functions bli_obj_init_finish_1x1() and bli_obj_init_finish(),
      which are similar to the previously-called functions,
      bli_obj_create_1x1_with_attached_buffer() and
      bli_obj_create_with_attached_buffer(), respectively. (The BLAS
      compatibility layer updates mentioned above employ this new technique
      as well.)
    - Transformed certain routines in bli_param_map.c--specifically, the
      ones that convert netlib-style parameters to BLIS equivalents--into
      static functions, now in bli_param_map.h. (The remaining three classes
      of conversation routines were left unchanged.)
    - Added the aforementioned pre-initializor macros to bli_type_defs.h.
    - Relocated bli_obj_init_const() and bli_obj_init_constdata() from
      bli_obj_macro_defs.h to bli_type_defs.h.
    - Added a few macros to bli_param_macro_defs.h for testing domains for
      real/complexness and precisions for single/double-ness.

      pasting function invocations into matlab to generate plots that are
      presently of interest to us.

      not configuration families such as amd64, intel64, and x86_64).
      This more or less reverts 5190d05 and 6cf1550.

    Disable TBM, XOP, LWP instructions in AMD configs.
    
    Details:
    - Added -mno-tbm -mno-xop -mno-lwp to CKVECFLAGS in bulldozer,
      piledriver, steamroller, and excavator configurations to explicitly
      disable AMD's bulldozer-era TBM, XOP, and LWP instruction sets in an
      attempt to fix the invalid instruction error that has plagued Travis
      CI builds since 6a014a3. Thanks to Devin Matthews for pointing out
      that the offending instruction was part of TBM (issue #300).
    - Restored -O3 to piledriver configuration's COPTFLAGS.

    Redirect trsm pc, ir parallelism to ic, jr loops.
    
    Details:
    - trsm parallelization was temporarily simplifed in 075143d to entirely
      ignore any parallelism specified via the pc or ir loops. Now, any
      parallelism specified to the pc loop will be redirected to the ic
      loop, and any parallelism specified to the ir loop will be redirected
      to the jr loop. (Note that because of inter-iteration dependencies,
      trsm cannot parallelize the ir loop. Parallelism via the pc loop is
      at least somewhat feasible in theory, but it would require tracking
      dependencies between blocks--something for which BLIS currently lacks
      the necessary supporting infrastructure.)

    Added support for IC loop parallelism to trsm.
    
    Details:
    - Parallelism within the IC loop (3rd loop around the microkernel) is
      now supported within the trsm operation. This is done via a new branch
      on each of the control and thread trees, which guide execution of a
      new trsm-only subproblem from within bli_trsm_blk_var1(). This trsm
      subproblem corresponds to the macrokernel computation on only the
      block of A that contains the diagonal (labeled as A11 in algorithms
      with FLAME-like partitioning), and the corresponding row panel of C.
      During the trsm subproblem, all threads within the JC communicator
      participate and parallelize along the JR loop, including any
      parallelism that was specified for the IC loop. (IR loop parallelism
      is not supported for trsm due to inter-iteration dependencies.) After
      this trsm subproblem is complete, a barrier synchronizes all
      participating threads and then they proceed to apply the prescribed
      BLIS_IC_NT (or equivalent) ways of parallelism (and any BLIS_JR_NT
      parallelism specified within) to the remaining gemm subproblem (the
      rank-k update that is performed using the newly updated row-panel of
      B). Thus, trsm now supports JC, IC, and JR loop parallelism.
    - Modified bli_trsm_l_cntl_create() to create the new "prenode" branch
      of the trsm_l cntl_t tree. The trsm_r tree was left unchanged, for
      now, since it is not currently used. (All trsm problems are cast in
      terms of left-side trsm.)
    - Updated bli_cntl_free_w_thrinfo() to be able to free the newly shaped
      trsm cntl_t trees. Fixed a potentially latent bug whereby a cntl_t
      subnode is only recursed upon if there existed a corresponding
      thrinfo_t node, which may not always exist (for problems too small
      to employ full parallelization due to the minimum granularity imposed
      by micropanels).
    - Updated other functions in frame/base/bli_cntl.c, such as
      bli_cntl_copy() and bli_cntl_mark_family(), to recurse on sub-prenodes
      if they exist.
    - Updated bli_thrinfo_free() to recurse into sub-nodes and prenodes
      when they exist, and added support for growing a prenode branch to
      bli_thrinfo_grow() via a corresponding set of help functions named
      with the _prenode() suffix.
    - Added a bszid_t field thrinfo_t nodes. This field comes in handy when
      debugging the allocation/release of thrinfo_t nodes, as it helps trace
      the "identity" of each nodes as it is created/destroyed.
    - Renamed
        bli_l3_thrinfo_print_paths() -> bli_l3_thrinfo_print_gemm_paths()
      and created a separate bli_l3_thrinfo_print_trsm_paths() function to
      print out the newly reconfigured thrinfo_t trees for the trsm
      operation.
    - Trival changes to bli_gemm_blk_var?.c and bli_trsm_blk_var?.c
      regarding variable declarations.
    - Removed subpart_t enum values BLIS_SUBPART1T, BLIS_SUBPART1B,
      BLIS_SUBPART1L, BLIS_SUBPART1R. Then added support for two new labels
      (semantically speaking): BLIS_SUBPART1A and BLIS_SUBPART1B, which
      represent the subpartition ahead of and behind, respectively,
      BLIS_SUBPART1. Updated check functions in bli_check.c accordingly.
    - Shuffled layering/APIs for bli_acquire_mpart_[mn]dim() and
      bli_acquire_mpart_t2b/b2t(), _l2r/r2l().
    - Deprecated old functions in frame/3/bli_l3_thrinfo.c.

    Details:
    - Added and registered power9 sub-configuration into the build system.
      Thanks to Nicholai Tukanov and Devangi Parikh for these contributions.
    - Note: The sub-configuration does not yet have a corresponding
      architecture-specific kernel set registered, and so for now the
      sub-config is using the generic kernel set.

    Generalized ref kernels' pragma omp simd usage.
    
    Details:
    - Replaced direct usage of _Pragma( "omp simd" ) in reference kernels
      with PRAGMA_SIMD, which is defined as a function of the compiler being
      used in a new bli_pragma_macro_defs.h file. That definition is cleared
      when BLIS detects that the -fopenmp-simd command line option is
      unsupported. Thanks to Devin Matthews and Jeff Hammond for suggestions
      that guided this commit.
    - Updated configure and bli_config.h.in so that the appropriate anchor
      is substituted in (when the corresponding pragma omp simd support is
      present).

    Details:
    - Changed all occurrances of
        micro-kernel -> microkernel
        macro-kernel -> macrokernel
        micro-panel  -> micropanel
      in all markdown documents in 'docs' directory. This change is being
      made since we've reached the point in adoption and acceptance of
      BLIS's insights where words such as "microkernel" are no longer new,
      and therefore now merit being unhyphenated.
    - Updated "Implementation Notes" sections of KernelsHowTo.md, which
      still contained references to nonexistent cpp macros such as
      BLIS_DEFAULT_MR_? and BLIS_PACKDIM_MR_?.
    - Added 'run-fast' and 'check-fast' targets to testsuite/Makefile.
    - Minor updates to Testsuite.md, including suggesting use of
      'make check' and 'make check-fast' when running from the local
      testsuite directory.
    - Added a comment to top-level Makefile explaining the purpose behind
      the TESTSUITE_WRAPPER variable, which at first glance appears to serve
      no purpose.

    Fixed bug in skx subconfig related to bdd46f9.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed code in the skx subconfiguration that became a bug after
      committing bdd46f9. Specifically, the bli_cntx_init_skx() function
      was overwriting default blocksizes for the scomplex and dcomplex
      microkernels despite the fact that only single and double real
      microkernels were being registered. This was not a problem prior to
      bdd46f9 since all microkernels used dynamically-queried (at runtime)
      register blocksizes for loop bounds. However, post-bdd46f9, this
      became a bug because the reference ukernels for scomplex and dcomplex
      were written with their register blocksizes hard-coded as constant
      loop bounds, which conflicted the the erroneous scomplex and dcomplex
      values that bli_cntx_init_skx() was setting in the context. The
      lesson here is that going forward, all subconfigurations must not set
      any blocksizes for datatypes corresponding to default/reference
      microkernels. (Note that a blocksize is left unchanged by the
      bli_cntx_set_blkszs() function if it was set to -1.)

    Fixed undefined behavior trsm ukr bug in bdd46f9.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug that mainfested anytime a configuration was used in which
      optimized microkernels were registered and the trsm operation (or
      kernel) was invoked. The bug resulted from the optimized microkernels'
      register blocksizes conflicting with the hard-coded values--expressed
      in the form of constant loop bounds--used in the new reference trsm
      ukernels that were introduced in bdd46f9. The fix was easy: reverting
      back to the implementation that uses variable-bound loops, which
      amounted to changing an #if 0 to #if 1 (since I preserved the older
      implementation in the file alongside the new code based on constant-
      bound loops). It should be noted that this fix must be permanent,
      since the trsm kernel code with constant-bound loops can never work
      with gemm ukernels that use different register blocksizes.

    Rewrote reference kernels to use #pragma omp simd.
    
    Details:
    - Rewrote level-1v, -1f, and -3 reference kernels in terms of simplified
      indexing annotated by the #pragma omp simd directive, which a compiler
      can use to vectorize certain constant-bounded loops. (The new kernels
      actually use _Pragma("omp simd") since the kernels are defined via
      templatizing macros.) Modest speedup was observed in most cases using
      gcc 5.4.0, which may improve with newer versions. Thanks to Devin
      Matthews for suggesting this via issue #286 and #259.
    - Updated default blocksizes defined in ref_kernels/bli_cntx_ref.c to
      be 4x16, 4x8, 4x8, and 4x4 for single, double, scomplex and dcomplex,
      respectively, with a default row preference for the gemm ukernel. Also
      updated axpyf, dotxf, and dotxaxpyf fusing factors to 8, 6, and 4,
      respectively, for all datatypes.
    - Modified configure to verify that -fopenmp-simd is a valid compiler
      option (via a new detect/omp_simd/omp_simd_detect.c file).
    - Added a new header in which prefetch macros are defined according to
      which compiler is detected (via macros such as __GNUC__). These
      prefetch macros are not yet employed anywhere, though.
    - Updated the year in copyrights of template license headers in
      build/templates and removed AMD as a default copyright holder.

    Minor tweaks/cleanups to bli_malloc.c, _apool.c.
    
    Details:
    - Removed malloc_ft and free_ft function pointer arguments from the
      interface to bli_apool_init() after deciding that there is no need to
      specify the malloc()/free() for blocks within the apool. (The apool
      blocks are actually just array_t structs.) Instead, we simply call
      bli_malloc_intl()/_free_intl() directly. This has the added benefit
      of allowing additional output when memory tracing is enabled via
      --enable-mem-tracing. Also made corresponding changes elsewhere in
      the apool API.
    - Changed the inner pools (elements of the array_t within the apool_t)
      to use BLIS_MALLOC_POOL and BLIS_FREE_POOL instead of BLIS_MALLOC_INTL
      and BLIS_FREE_INTL.
    - Disabled definitions of bli_malloc_pool() and bli_free_pool() since
      there are no longer any consumers of these functions.
    - Very minor comment / printf() updates.

    - Updated/added comments about Fedora, OpenSUSE, and GNU Guix under the
      newly-renamed "External GNU/Linux packages" section. Thanks to Dave
      Love for providing these revisions.

    Allow running configure with python 3.4.
    
    Details:
    - Relax version blacklisting of python3 to allow 3.4 or later instead
      of 3.5 or later. Thanks to Dave Love for pointing out that 3.4 was
      sufficient for the purpose of BLIS's build system. (It should be
      noted that we're not sure which, if any, python3 versions prior to
      3.4 are insufficient, and that the only thing stopping us from
      determining this is the fact that these earlier versions of python3
      are not readily available for us to test with.)
    - Updated docs/BuildSystem.md to be explicit about current python2 vs
      python3 version requirements.

    Add error message to malloc() check for NULL.
    
    Details:
    - Output an error message if and when the malloc()-equivalent called by
      bli_fmalloc_align() ever returns NULL. Everything was already in place
      for this to happen, including the error return code, the error string
      sprintf(), the error checking function bli_check_valid_malloc_buf()
      definition, and its prototype. Thanks to Minh Quan Ho for pointing out
      the missing error message.
    - Increased the default block_ptrs_len for each inner pool stored in the
      small block allocator from 10 to 25. Under normal execution, each
      thread uses only 21 blocks, so this change will prevent the sba from
      needing to resize the block_ptrs array of any given inner pool as
      threads initially populate the pool with small blocks upon first
      execution of a level-3 operation.
    - Nix stray newline echo in configure.

    Implemented a pool-based small block allocator.
    
    Details:
    - Implemented a sophisticated data structure and set of APIs that track
      the small blocks of memory (around 80-100 bytes each) used when
      creating nodes for control and thread trees (cntl_t and thrinfo_t) as
      well as thread communicators (thrcomm_t). The purpose of the small
      block allocator, or sba, is to allow the library to transition into a
      runtime state in which it does not perform any calls to malloc() or
      free() during normal execution of level-3 operations, regardless of
      the threading environment (potentially multiple application threads
      as well as multiple BLIS threads). The functionality relies on a new
      data structure, apool_t, which is (roughly speaking) a pool of
      arrays, where each array element is a pool of small blocks. The outer
      pool, which is protected by a mutex, provides separate arrays for each
      application thread while the arrays each handle multiple BLIS threads
      for any given application thread. The design minimizes the potential
      for lock contention, as only concurrent application threads would
      need to fight for the apool_t lock, and only if they happen to begin
      their level-3 operations at precisely the same time. Thanks to Kiran
      Varaganti and AMD for requesting this feature.
    - Added a configure option to disable the sba pools, which are enabled
      by default; renamed the --[dis|en]able-packbuf-pools option to
      --[dis|en]able-pba-pools; and rewrote the --help text associated with
      this new option and consolidated it with the --help text for the
      option associated with the sba (--[dis|en]able-sba-pools).
    - Moved the membrk field from the cntx_t to the rntm_t. We now pass in
      a rntm_t* to the bli_membrk_acquire() and _release() APIs, just as we
      do for bli_sba_acquire() and _release().
    - Replaced all calls to bli_malloc_intl() and bli_free_intl() that are
      used for small blocks with calls to bli_sba_acquire(), which takes a
      rntm (in addition to the bytes requested), and bli_sba_release().
      These latter two functions reduce to the former two when the sba pools
      are disabled at configure-time.
    - Added rntm_t* arguments to various cntl_t and thrinfo_t functions, as
      required by the new usage of bli_sba_acquire() and _release().
    - Moved the freeing of "old" blocks (those allocated prior to a change
      in the block_size) from bli_membrk_acquire_m() to the implementation
      of the pool_t checkout function.
    - Miscellaneous improvements to the pool_t API.
    - Added a block_size field to the pblk_t.
    - Harmonized the way that the trsm_ukr testsuite module performs packing
      relative to that of gemmtrsm_ukr, in part to avoid the need to create
      a packm control tree node, which now requires a rntm_t that has been
      initialized with an sba and membrk.
    - Re-enable explicit call bli_finalize() in testsuite so that users who
      run the testsuite with memory tracing enabled can check for memory
      leaks.
    - Manually imported the compact/minor changes from 61441b24 that cause
      the rntm to be copied locally when it is passed in via one of the
      expert APIs.
    - Reordered parameters to various bli_thrcomm_*() functions so that the
      thrcomm_t* to the comm being modified is last, not first.
    - Added more descriptive tracing for allocating/freeing small blocks and
      formalized via a new configure option: --[dis|en]able-mem-tracing.
    - Moved some unused scalm code and headers into frame/1m/other.
    - Whitespace changes to bli_pthread.c.
    - Regenerated build/libblis-symbols.def.

    Make local copy of user's rntm_t in level-3 ops.
    
    Details:
    - In the case that the caller passes in a non-NULL rntm_t pointer into
      one of the expert APIs for a level-3 operation (e.g. bli_gemm_ex()),
      make a local copy of the rntm_t and use the address of that local copy
      in all subsequent execution (which may change the contents of the
      rntm_t). This prevents a potentially confusing situation whereby a
      user-initialized rntm_t is used once (in, say, gemm), and then found
      by the user to be in a different state before it is used a second
      time.

    Fixed BLAS test failures of small matrix SYRK for single and double precision.
    
    Details:
    - SYRK for small matrix was implemented by reusing small GEMM routine. This was
      resulting in output written to the full C matrix, and C being symmetric the
      lower and upper triangles of C matrix contained same results. BLAS SYRK API
      spec demands either lower or upper triangle of C matrix to be written with
      results. So, this was resulting in BLAS test failures, even though testsuite
      of BLIS was passing small SYRK operation.
    - To fix BLAS test failures of small matrix SYRK, separate kernel routines are
      implemented for small SYRK for both single and double precision. The newly
      added small SYRK routines are in file kernels/zen/3/bli_syrk_small.c.
      Now the intermediate results of matrix C are written to a scratch buffer.
      Final results are written from scratch buffer to matrix C using SIMD
      copy to either lower or upper traingle part of matrix C.
    - Source and header files frame/3/syrk/bli_syrk_front.c and
      frame/3/syrk/bli_syrk_front.h are changed to invoke new small SYRK routines.

    Added missing bli_init_once() in bli_thread API.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed an issue with specifying threading globally at runtime via
      bli_thread_set_num_threads() (the automatic way) or via
      bli_thread_set_ways() (the manual way), with bli_thread_init_rntm()
      also affected. These functions were not calling bli_init_once() prior
      to acting, and therefore their effects on the global rntm_t structure
      were being wiped out by the eventual call to bli_init_once(), by some
      other BLIS function. Thanks to Ali Emre Gülcü for reporting the
      behavior associated with this bug.
    - Added additional content to docs/Multithreading.md covering topics of
      choosing between OpenMP and pthreads, and specifying affinity via
      OpenMP.

    Improvements to bli_pool; malloc()/free() tracing.
    
    Details:
    - Added malloc_ft and free_ft fields to pool_t, which are provided when
      the pool is initialized, to allow bli_pool_alloc_block() and
      bli_pool_free_block() to call bli_fmalloc_align()/bli_ffree_align()
      with arbitrary align_size values (according to how the pool_t was
      initialized).
    - Added a block_ptrs_len argument to bli_pool_init(), which allows the
      caller to specify an initial length for the block_ptrs array, which
      previously suffered the cost of being reallocated, copied, and freed
      each time a new block was added to the pool.
    - Consolidated the "buf_sys" and "buf_align" pointer fields in pblk_t
      into a single "buf" field. Consolidated the bli_pblk API accordingly
      and also updated the bli_mem API implementation. This was done
      because I'd previously already implemented opaque alignment via
      bli_malloc_align(), which allocates extra space and stores the
      original pointer returned by malloc() one element before the element
      whose address is aligned.
    - Tweaked bli_membrk_acquire_m() and bli_membrk_release() to call
      bli_fmalloc_align() and bli_ffree_align(), which required adding an
      align_size field to the membrk_t struct.
    - Pass the pack schemas directly into bli_l3_cntl_create_if() rather
      than transmit them via objects for A and B.
    - Simplified bli_l3_cntl_free_if() and renamed to bli_l3_cntl_free().
      The function had not been conditionally freeing control trees for
      quite some time. Also, removed obj_t* parameters since they aren't
      needed anymore (or never were).
    - Spun-off OpenMP nesting code in bli_l3_thread_decorator() to a
      separate function, bli_l3_thread_decorator_thread_check().
    - Renamed:
        bli_malloc_align()   -> bli_fmalloc_align()
        bli_free_align()     -> bli_ffree_align()
        bli_malloc_noalign() -> bli_fmalloc_noalign()
        bli_free_noalign()   -> bli_ffree_noalign()
      The 'f' is for "function" since they each take a malloc_ft or free_ft
      function pointer argument.
    - Inserted various printf() calls for the purposes of tracing memory
      allocation and freeing, guarded by cpp macro ENABLE_MEM_DEBUG, which,
      for now, is intended to be a "hidden" feature rather than one hooked
      up to a configure-time option.
    - Defined bli_rntm_equals(), which compares two rntm_t for equality.
      (There are no use cases for this function yet, but there may be soon.)
    - Whitespace changes to function parameter lists in bli_pool.c, .h.

    Handle edge cases, zero-filling in packm kernels.
    
    Details:
    - Updated the API and semantics of packm kernels such that they must now
      handle edge cases, meaning that a c-by-k packm kernel must be able to
      pack edge cases that are fewer than c rows/columns and be able to
      zero-fill the remaining elements. They must also be able to zero-fill
      the equivalent region when copying fewer than k columns/rows (which is
      needed by trsm). The new packm kernel API is generally:
    
        void packm_kernel
             (
               conj_t           conja,
               dim_t            cdim,
               dim_t            n,
               dim_t            n_max,
               ctype*  restrict kappa,
               ctype*  restrict a, inc_t inca, inc_t lda,
               ctype*  restrict p,             inc_t ldp,
               cntx_t* restrict cntx
             );
    
      where cdim and n are the dimensions (short and long, respectively) of
      the submatrix being copied from the source matrix A, and n_max is the
      "full" long dimension (corresponding to the k dimension in gemm) of
      the micropanel. The "full" short dimension (corresponding to the
      register blocksize MR or NR) is not part of the API because it is
      known intrinsically by the packm kernel implementation. Thanks to
      Devin Matthews for prompting us to make this change (#282).
    - Updated all reference packm kernels in ref_kernels/1m according to
      above changes, as well as all optimized packm kernels (which only
      consisted of those for knl).
    - Bumped the major soname version number in 'so_version' to 2. At first
      I was considering leaving it unchanged, but I couldn't escape the
      reality that the packm kernel API is much closer to an expert API
      than it is some obscure helper function interface within the framework
      that nobody would ever notice.
    - Removed reference packm kernels for mr/nr = 30. The only sub-config
      that would have been using those kernels is knc, which is likely no
      longer being used by very many people (if any). (This also mostly
      offset the larger object code footprint incurred by moving the edge-
      case handling into the individual packm kernels.)
    - Fixed an obscure race condition for 3mh and 4mh induced methods in
      which those implementations were modifying the contexts stored in the
      gks rather than a local copy.
    - Fixed a minor bug in the testsuite that prevented non-1m-based induced
      method implementations of trsm from executing.

    Disabled ARM configuration families in registry.
    
    Details:
    - Disabled (commented out) the arm32 and arm64 configuration families
      in the config_registry file. Having a configuration family registered
      only makes sense if BLIS is currently outfitted with runtime hardware
      detection logic to choose the appropriate sub-configuration. That
      logic is currently missing for ARM architectures, and thus having the
      ARM configuration families in the configuration registry only serves
      to confuse people. Thanks to Devangi Parikh for suggesting this
      change.

      port recent changes to the former to the latter.
    - Disabled (for now) code in 3m4m/test_*.c files that disables all
      induced methods except for the one that is requested from the
      Makefile via the IND macro. This is done because usually, we want to
      test whatever method is enabled automatically for complex datatypes.
      (That is, when native complex microkernels are missing, we usually
      want to test performance of 1m.)

    Remove UT-Austin from copyright headers' clause 3.
    
    Details:
    - Removed explicit reference to The University of Texas at Austin in the
      third clause of the license comment blocks of all relevant files and
      replaced it with a more all-encompassing "copyright holder(s)".
    - Removed duplicate words ("derived") from a few kernels' license
      comment blocks.
    - Homogenized license comment block in kernels/zen/3/bli_gemm_small.c
      with format of all other comment blocks.

Author: Field G. Van Zee <field@cs.utexas.edu>
Date:   Mon Dec 3 17:49:52 2018 -0600

    Added mixed-precision support to 1m method.
    
    Details:
    - Lifted the constraint that 1m only be used when all operands' storage
      datatypes (along with the computation datatype) are equal. Now, 1m may
      be used as long as all operands are stored in the complex domain. This
      change largely consisted of adding the ability to pack to 1e and 1r
      formats from one precision to another. It also required adding logic
      for handling complex values of alpha to bli_packm_blk_var1_md()
      (similar to the logic in bli_packm_blk_var1()).
    - Fixed a bug in several virtual microkernels (bli_gemm_md_c2r_ref.c,
      bli_gemm1m_ref.c, and bli_gemmtrsm1m_ref.c) that resulted in the wrong
      ukernel output preference field being read. Previously, the preference
      for the native complex ukernel was being read instead of the pref for
      the native real domain ukernel. This bug would not manifest if the
      preference for the native complex ukernel happened to be equal to that
      of the native real ukernel.
    - Added support for testing mixed-precision 1m execution via the gemm
      module of the testsuite.
    - Tweaked/simplified bli_gemm_front() and bli_gemm_md.c so that pack
      schemas are always read from the context, rather than trying to
      sometimes embed them directly to the A and B objects. (They are still
      embedded, but now uniformly only after reading the schemas from the
      context.)
    - Redefined cpp macro bli_l3_ind_recast_1m_params() as a static function
      and renamed to bli_gemm_ind_recast_1m_params() (since gemm is the only
      consumer).
    - Added 1m optimization logic (via bli_gemm_ind_recast_1m_params()) to
      bli_gemm_ker_var2_md().
    - Added explicit handling for beta == 1 and beta == 0 in the reference
      gemm1m virtual microkernel in ref_kernels/ind/bli_gemm1m_ref.c.
    - Rewrote various level-0 macro defs, including axpyris, axpbyris,
      scal2ris, and xpbyris (and their conjugating counterparts) to
      explicitly support three operand types and updated invocations to
      xpbyris in bli_gemmtrsm1m_ref.c.
    - Query and use the storage datatype of the packed object instead of the
      storage datatype of the source object in bli_packm_blk_var1().
    - Relocated and renamed frame/ind/misc/bli_l3_ind_opt.h to
      frame/3/gemm/ind/bli_gemm_ind_opt.h.
    - Various whitespace/comment updates.

    Track internal scalar datatypes.
    
    Details:
    - Added a num_t datatype bitfield to the obj_t in the form of a new
      info2 field in the obj_t. This change was made primarily so that in
      the case of mixed-datatype gemm, the alpha scalar would not need to
      be cast to the storage datatype of B (or A) before then being cast to
      the computation datatype just before the macrokernel is called. This
      double-casting regime could result in loss of precision if the storage
      datatype of B (or A) is less than the computation precision. In
      practice, it was likely not going to be a big deal since most usage of
      alpha is for -1.0, 0.0, and 1.0 (or integer multiples thereof), which
      can all be represented exactly in single or double precision.
    - The type of objbits_t was changed to uint32_t, so the new format
      potentially takes up the same space as the previous obj_t definition,
      assuming no padding inserted by the compiler. Shrinking info to 32
      bits and spilling over into a second field was chosen over using the
      high 32 bits of a single 64-bit objbits_t info field because many of
      the bitwise operations are performed with enums such as num_t, dom_t,
      and prec_t, which may take on the type of 32-bit ints. It's easier to
      just keep all of those bitwise operations in 32 bits than perform a
      million typecasts throughout bli_type_defs.h and bli_obj_macro_defs.h
      to ensure that the integers are treated as 64-bit for the purposes of
      the ANDs, ORs, and bitshifts.
    - Many comment updates.
    - Thanks to Devin Matthews and Devangi Parikh for their feedback and
      involvement during this commit cycle.

    Tweak testsuite to issue FAIL for Nan, Inf (#279).
    
    Details:
    - Adjusted the definition for libblis_test_get_string_for_result() in
      testsuite/src/test_libblis.c so that the "FAIL" string is returned if
      the computed residual contains either NaN or Inf. Previously, a
      residual containing NaN would result in the selection of the "PASS"
      string. Thanks to Devin Matthews for reporting this issue (#279).
    - Expounded on comment for the macro definitions of bli_isnan() and
      bli_isinf() in bli_misc_macro_defs.h to make it more obvious why they
      must remain macros.

      floating-point datatypes. I expect to further refine these scripts as
      time goes on, but their current state constitutes a good start.

    Fixed a bug in high-level mixeddt conditional.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in frame/3/bli_l3_oapi.c in the conditional that divides
      use of induced method (1m) execution from native execution. The former
      was intended to only be used in cases where all storage datatypes are
      complex and the datatype of C is equal to the computation datatype.
      (If mixed datatypes are detected, native execution would be used.)
      However, the code in bli_gemm() was erroneously checking the execution
      datatype instead of the computation datatype, which at that point is
      guaranteed to be equal to the storage datatype even if the computation
      datatype contains a different value. Thanks to Devangi Parikh for
      helping in isolating this bug.

    - Cleaned up test/mixeddt Makefile in preparation for gathering new
      data for mixeddt paper, including renaming implementations to
      "internal" and "ad-hoc" to match the terminology to be used in the
      paper.
    - Added new matlab scripts for generating 8 figures, each covering all
      mixed-precision cases for each mixed-domain case.
    - Updated the runme.sh script according to changes to Makefile.
    - Fixed a minor bug in test_gemm.c that may have given incorrect
      performance in complex, homogeneous storage datatype cases where
      the computation precision was equal to the storage precisions.
      (Examples: zzzd, cccs.)

    Testsuite docs update for mixed-datatype gemm.
    
    Details:
    - Updated docs/Testsuite.md to include mention of the new mixed-domain
      and mixed-precision settings, including descriptions.
    - Updated docs/MixedDatatypes.md to include a brief section on running
      the testsuite to exercise mixed-datatype functionality, which mostly
      amounts to a link to the Testsuite.md document.
    - Minor verbiage change to testsuite output to correct a misleading
      label associated with the value returned by the query function
      bli_info_get_simd_num_registers(). (The function does not return the
      number of SIMD registers present in the hardware, but rather a maximum
      assumed value for the purposes of allocating temporary microtile
      workspace on the function stack.)

    Disallow 64b BLAS integers + 32b BLIS integers.
    
    Details:
    - Print an error message from configure if the user attempts to
      explicitly configure BLIS for simultaneous use of 64-bit integers in
      the BLAS API with 32-bit integers in the BLIS API.
    - Added cpp macro conditional to bli_type_defs.h to mandate that BLIS
      integers be 64 bits if the BLAS integers are 64 bits. This and the
      above item take care of issue #274. Thanks to Devin Matthews and
      Jeff Hammond for suggesting these safeguards.
    - Slight reorganization and relabeling (for clarity) of BLAS/CBLAS
      sections and BLIS integer size line of the testsuite configuration
      output.
    - Very minor edits to docs/MixedDatatypes.md.

    Details:
    - Added the missing bli_pthread_mutex_trylock() function and prototype
      to the non-Windows sections of bli_pthread.c and .h. This function
      isn't needed by BLIS, but I figured why not make the Windows and
      non-Windows sections consistent with one another.

      those types in terms of pthreads types on non-Windows, non-Apple OSes
      (i.e. Linux).

    Defined unified bli_pthreads_*() API for all OSes.
    
    Details:
    - Expanded the bli_pthread_*() -> pthread_*() wrappers in
      frame/thread/bli_pthread.c to include cases for Windows taken from
      frame/base/bli_pthread_wrap.c. Now, bli_thread_*() is always defined
      and always used by BLIS and the BLIS testsuite (in lieu of calling
      pthreads directly, as before). The implementation used in this new
      API depends on whether we are building for Windows, and to a lesser
      extent, whether we are building on OS X. For the core API, Windows
      uses Windows threads, non-Windows (Linux, OS X) uses pthreads.
      OS X and Windows get barriers implemented in terms of other
      bli_pthread_*() functions, and Linux gets barriers implemented in
      terms of pthread_barrier*(). This commit addresses issue #273.
    - Fixed a bug in the Linux definition of bli_pthread_mutex_unlock(),
      which was erroneously calling pthread_mutex_lock().
    - Minor changes to configure so that the auto-detection executable
      can be built given the above changes (most notably, turning on
      POSIX extensions via -D_GNU_SOURCE).
    - Removed temporary play-test code for shiftd that accidentally got
      committed into test/3m4m/test_gemm.c.

    Unconditionally define bli_l3_thread_entry().
    
    Details:
    - Define a dummy bli_l3_thread_entry() function when multithreading is
      disabled altogether, or enabled via OpenMP. This function was
      originally necessary when multithreading is enabled via pthreads.
      By defining the function no matter the threading options given, it is
      less likely that an AppVeyor Windows build will complain due to a
      missing symbol in the DLL. (To be clear: AppVeyor was working fine
      before, but a problem may have arisen if it were switched to an
      OpenMP build.)
    - Removed the prototype for bli_l3_thread_entry() from
      bli_thrcomm_pthreads.c and placed it in bli_thrcomm.h.
    - Regenerated the symbols list file build/libblis-symbols.def.

    - Added a new pair of input files to testsuite directory with the

      mixed-datatype gemm.
    - Updated docs/BuildSystem.md to document the new make targets

    Fixed thrinfo_t printing for small problems.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in the code that prints out the communicator and work ids
      from the various threads' thrinfo_t nodes. This bug manifested when
      the dimension being parallelized was not large enough such that every
      thread was assigned actual work (since the minimum amount of work is
      determined by the register blocksize in the dimension being
      parallelized). In those cases, the threads that receive no work in
      that dimension do not finish building their thrinfo_t tree, leaving
      lower-level nodes non-existent. (The bug itself was usally observed as
      a segfault when the printing code attempted to dereference all the way
      down the thrinfo_t tree.) The solution involves explicitly checking
      each node as it is dereferenced, and if at any time NULL is found, all
      subsequent communicator and work ids are set to -1.

    Implemented python version checking in configure.
    
    Details:
    - Added python version checking to configure script. (Recall that python
      is needed to execute the flatten-headers.py script.) Minimum versions
      of python needed are currently as follows:
        python2: 2.7 or later
        python3: 3.5 or later
      The standard search order for python interpeters is:
        python python3 python2
      The PYTHON environment variable is also supported and will be checked
      before the standard search order list.
    - Updated BuildSystem.md to include: a minimum make version; mention
      that the C compiler must actually be a C99 compiler; and the caveat
      that Windows builds do not require pthreads since BLIS can provide
      an implementation of pthreads internally.

    Added bli_pthread_*() API.
    
    Details:
    - Defined a bli_pthread_*() API so that the testsuite, when being linked
      against a Windows DLL, will be able to access pthreads functionality
      without those pthreads functions being explicitly exported by the DLL.
      Instead, we export the bli_pthread_*() layer, which uses types and
      functions that are identical to pthreads, but adds a 'bli_' prefix.
      Only a few basic functions are present in the bli_pthreads_*() API
      for now. Thanks to Devin Matthews and Isuru Fernando for their help
      on a related PR (#261) that this commit will hopefully facilitate.
    - Updated testsuite so that it calls bli_pthread_*() layer instead of
      pthread_*() functions directly.
    - Regenerated build/libblis-symbols.def.
    - Comment updated to build/regen-symbols.sh.

    Defined a new level-1d operation: shiftd.
    
    Details:
    - Defined a new level-1d operation called 'shiftd', including object and
      typed APIs. This operation adds a scalar value to every element along
      an arbitrary diagonal of a matrix. Currently, shiftd is implemented in
      terms of the addv kernel. (The scalar is passed in as the x vector
      with an increment of zero.)
    - Replaced ad-hoc usage of setd and addd (after creating a temporary
      matrix object) with use of shiftd, which is much more concise, in
      various test driver files in the testsuite. Similar changes were made
      to the standalone test drivers and the example code.
    - Added documentation entries in BLISObjectAPI.md and BLISTypedAPI.md
      for bli_shiftd() and bli_?shiftd(), respectively.
    - Added observed object properties to level-1d documentation in
      BLISObjectAPI.md.

    Renamed/moved l3 zen ukernels to haswell kernel set.
    
    Details:
    - Renamed the microkernels in kernels/zen/3 to kernels/haswell/3 and
      then updated the file contents to use the 'haswell' infix.
    - Updated bli_cntx_init_zen.c and bli_cntx_init_haswell.c according to
      above function renames.
    - Moved/updated the corresponding prototypes in bli_kernels_zen.h to
      bli_kernels_haswell.h.
    - Updated config_registry according to above changes.
    - NOTE: This rename reflects the fact that haswell microkernels are
      specifically written to overcome the floating-point latency for FMA
      instructions on Intel Haswell-like architectures, which can issue two
      FMA instructions per cycle. These ukernels happen to work fine on AMD
      Zen-based architectures. However, Zen only issues one FMA per cycle,
      which, while halving its floating-point throughput, gives it extra
      flexibility in the design of its microkernels--namely, mr and nr can
      be smaller and still overcome the floating-point latency for those
      single-issue cores. A smaller value of mr and nr allows for a larger
      value of kc, which may be useful in some situations. In the future,
      we may write such Zen-specific microkernels to take advantage of this
      additional flexibility.

    Consolidated slab/rr-explicit level-3 macrokernels.
    
    Details:
    - Consolidated the *sl.c and *rr.c level-3 macrokernels into a single
      file per sl/rr pair, with those files named as they were before
      c92762e. The consolidation does not take away the *option* of using
      slab or round-robin assignment of micropanels to threads; it merely
      *hides* the choice within the definitions of functions such as
      bli_thread_range_jrir(), bli_packm_my_iter(), and bli_is_last_iter()
      rather than expose that choice explicitly in the code. The choice of
      slab or rr is not always hidden, however; there are some cases
      involving herk and trmm, for example, that require some part of the
      computation to use rr unconditionally. (The --thread-part-jrir option
      controls the partitioning in all other cases.)
    - Note: Originally, the sl and rr macrokernels were separated out for
      clarity. However, aside from the additional binary code bloat, I later
      deemed that clarity not worth the price of maintaining the additional
      (mostly similar) codes.

    Execute flatten-headers.py via $(PYTHON).
    
    Details:
    - Execute build/flatten-headers.py python script via $(PYTHON) in
      common.mk. This allows distributions that define the current/preferred
      python interpreter in the PYTHON environment variable to use that
      interpreter when executing flatten-headers.py. Thanks to Isuru
      Fernando for this suggestion, and for Dave Love for submitting the
      initial issue/request.

    Fixed merge fail on testsuite threading macros.
    
    Details:
    - Applied the following C preprocessor macro renames
    
        BLIS_DEFAULT_MR_THREAD_MAX  -> BLIS_THREAD_MAX_IR
        BLIS_DEFAULT_NR_THREAD_MAX  -> BLIS_THREAD_MAX_JR
        BLIS_DEFAULT_M_THREAD_RATIO -> BLIS_THREAD_RATIO_M
        BLIS_DEFAULT_N_THREAD_RATIO -> BLIS_THREAD_RATIO_N
    
      in src/test_libblis.c. This is apparently the result of a failure by
      git to properly merge the 'master' and 'amd' branches in the previous
      commit. (The 'master' branch contained a commit, 53a9ab1, in which
      these same cpp macros were renamed throughout the source distribution.

    Implemented mixed-datatype support for gemm.
    
    Details:
    - Implemented support for gemm where A, B, and C may have different
      storage datatypes, as well as a computational precision (and implied
      computation domain) that may be different from the storage precision
      of either A or B. This results in 128 different combinations, all
      which are implemented within this commit. (For now, the mixed-datatype
      functionality is only supported via the object API.) If desired, the
      mixed-datatype support may be disabled at configure-time.
    - Added a memory-intensive optimization to certain mixed-datatype cases
      that requires a single m-by-n matrix be allocated (temporarily) per
      call to gemm. This optimization aims to avoid the overhead involved in
      repeatedly updating C with general stride, or updating C after a
      typecast from the computation precision. This memory optimization may
      be disabled at configure-time (provided that the mixed-datatype
      support is enabled in the first place).
    - Added support for testing mixed-datatype combinations to testsuite.
      The user may test gemm with mixed domains, precisions, both, or
      neither.
    - Added a standalone test driver directory for building and running
      mixed-datatype performance experiments.
    - Defined a new variation of castm, castnzm, which operates like castm
      except that imaginary values are not touched when casting a real
      operand to a complex operand. (By contrast, in these situations castm
      sets the imaginary components of the destination matrix to zero.)
    - Defined bli_obj_imag_is_zero() and substituted calls in lieu of all
      usages of bli_obj_imag_equals() that tested against BLIS_ZERO, and
      also simplified the implementation of bli_obj_imag_equals().
    - Fixed bad behavior from bli_obj_is_real() and bli_obj_is_complex()
      when given BLIS_CONSTANT objects.
    - Disabled dt_on_output field in auxinfo_t structure as well as all
      accessor functions. Also commented out all usage of accessor
      functions within macrokernels. (Typecasting in the microkernel is
      still feasible, though probably unrealistic for now given the
      additional complexity required.)
    - Use void function pointer type (instead of void*) for storing function
      pointers in bli_l0_fpa.c.
    - Added documentation for using gemm with mixed datatypes in
      docs/MixedDatatypes.md and example code in examples/oapi/11gemm_md.c.
    - Defined level-1d operation xpbyd and level-1m operation xpbym.
    - Added xpbym test module to testsuite.
    - Updated frame/include/bli_x86_asm_macros.h with additional macros
      (courtsey of Devin Matthews).

    Renamed thread auto-factorization macro constants.
    
    Details:
    - Renamed the following C preprocessor macros whose fallback/default
      values are specified within frame/include/bli_kernel_macro_defs.h:
    
        BLIS_DEFAULT_MR_THREAD_MAX  -> BLIS_THREAD_MAX_IR
        BLIS_DEFAULT_NR_THREAD_MAX  -> BLIS_THREAD_MAX_JR

        BLIS_DEFAULT_N_THREAD_RATIO -> BLIS_THREAD_RATIO_N
    
    - Renamed the above cpp macro overrides within the knl, skx, and zen
      sub-configurations, as well as invocations of those macros in
      bli_rntm.c.
    - Moved config/zen/bli_kernel.h to an 'old' directory as it is no longer
      used by any code within BLIS.

    Allow trsm_l parallelism in the jc loop.
    
    Details:
    - Previously, trsm was consolidating all ways of parallelism into the jr
      loop. This was unnecessary and to some degree detrimental on some
      types of hardware. Now, any parallelism bound for the jc loop will be
      applied to the jc loop, while all other loops' parallelism is funneled
      to the jr loop. Thanks to Devangi Parikh for helping investigate this
      issue and suggesting the fix.
    - NOTE: This change affects only left-side trsm. However, currently
      right-side trsm is currently implemented in terms of the left-side
      case, and thus the change effectively applies to both left and right
      cases.

    Output threading status/params from testsuite.
    
    Details:
    - Updated testsuite to output various parameters related to parallelism
      in BLIS. These parameters include:
      - threading status: disabled, openmp, or pthreads;
      - thread partitioning for jr/ir loops: slab or rr (round-robin);
      - ways of parallelism from environment variables, and also actual
        values used by gemm, herk, trmm_l, trmm_r, trsm_l, and trsm_r for
        square problems (assuming all dimensions are set to 1000);
      - automatic thread factorization parameters.
    - Also output the status of two relatively new configure-time options:
      libmemkind and the sandbox.

    Added option of slab or rr partitioning in jr/ir.
    
    Details:
    - Updated existing macrokernel function names and definitions to
      explicitly use slab assignment of micropanels to threads, then created
      duplicate versions of macrokernels that explicitly use round-robin
      assignment instead of slab. NOTE: As in ac18949, trsm_r macrokernels
      were not substantially updated in this commit because they are
      currently disabled in bli_trsm_front.c.
    - Updated existing packing function (in blk_packm_blk_var1.c) to
      explicitly use slab partitioning, and then duplicated for round-robin.
    - Updated control tree initialization to use the appropriate macrokernel
      and packm function pointers depending on which method (slab or rr) was
      enabled at configure-time.
    - Updated configure script to accept new --thread-part-jrir=[slab|rr]
      option (-m [slab|rr] for short), which allows the user to explicitly
      request either slab or round-robin assignment (partitioning) of
      micropanels to threads.
    - Updated sandbox/ref99 according to above changes.
    - Minor updates to build/add-copyright.py.

    Removed 1h short-circuit from bli_clock_min_diff().
    
    Details:
    - Removed a guard from bli_clock_min_diff() that would return 0 if the
      time delta was greater than 60 minutes. This was originally intended
      to disregard extremely large values under the assumption that the
      user probably didn't intend to run a test that long. However, since
      it is in bli_clock_min_diff(), it doesn't actually help short-circuit
      an implementation that is hanging or looping infinitely, since such
      an implementation would first have to finish before the
      bli_clock_min_diff() is called. Thanks to Kiran Varaganti for
      reporting this issue.

    This is a fix to floating-point exception error for BLIS SGEMM with larger matrix sizes.
    BUG No: CPUPL-197 fixed by Thangaraj Santanu
    The bli_clock_min_diff() function in BLIS assumed that if the time taken is greater than 1 hour then the reading must be wrong. However this is not the case in general, while the other checks such as time taken closer to zero or nsec is ofcourse valid.

    Fixed misleading version query from gcc 7+.
    
    Details:
    - gcc 7 introduced new behavior to the -dumpversion option whereby only
      the major version component is output. However, as part of this
      change, gcc 7 also introduced a new option, -dumpfullversion, which is
      guaranteed to always output the major, minor, and revision numbers. If
      we are using gcc 7 or later, we re-query the version string with this
      new option and then re-parse the result so as to avoid misleading
      output from configure (e.g. using gcc 7.3.0 is reported as 7.7.7).

      integer potentially overflowing the available space in the string into
      which the integer is being printed.

    Multithreading optimizations for l3 macrokernels.
    
    Details:
    - Adjusted the method by which micropanels are assigned to threads in
      the 2nd (jr) and 1st (ir) loops around the microkernel to (mostly)
      employ contiguous "slab" partitioning rather than interleaved (round
      robin) partitioning. The new partitioning schemes and related details
      for specific families of operations are listed below:
      - gemm: slab partitioning.
      - herk: slab partitioning for region corresponding to non-triangular
              region of C; round robin partitioning for triangular region.
      - trmm: slab partitioning for region corresponding to non-triangular
              region of B; round robin partitioning for triangular region.
              (NOTE: This affects both left- and right-side macrokernels:
              trmm_ll, trmm_lu, trmm_rl, trmm_ru.)
      - trsm: slab partitioning.
              (NOTE: This only affects only left-side macrokernels trsm_ll,
              trsm_lu; right-side macrokernels were not touched.)
      Also note that the previous macrokernels were preserved inside of
      the 'other' directory of each operation family directory (e.g.
      frame/3/gemm/other, frame/3/herk/other, etc).
    - Updated gemm macrokernel in sandbox/ref99 in light of above changes
      and fixed a stale function pointer type in blx_gemm_int.c
      (gemm_voft -> gemm_var_oft).
    - Added standalone test drivers in test/3m4m for herk, trmm, and trsm
      and minor changes to test/3m4m/Makefile.
    - Updated the arguments and definitions of bli_*_get_next_[ab]_upanel()
      and bli_trmm_?_?r_my_iter() macros defined in bli_l3_thrinfo.h.
    - Renamed bli_thread_get_range*() APIs to bli_thread_range*().

    Allow slashes ('/') in version tags.
    
    Details:
    - Updated the configure script to allow slashes in version string. This
      is needed so that downstream maintainers (such as those for Debian)
      can create local tags such as "upstream/0.4.1". Thanks to M. Zhou for
      reporting this issue via PR #256 and providing me the information
      needed to debug the problem.

    Added statistics-collecting irun.py script.
    
    Details:
    - Added irun.py script to 'build' directory. This irun.py script is a
      python script for repeatedly invoking a test driver executable, such
      as those found in test/3m4m, and replace the performance output column
      with four columns that aggregate statistics. Specifically, the script
      reports the minimum, average, maximum, and standard deviation for each
      problem size. This script is useful especially (though not
      exclusively) when trying to determine the impact of relatively minor
      changes to the code, or other small optimizations that may be
      difficult to distinguish from "noise." One way this "noise" manifests
      is that a test executable may run slightly slower or faster for all
      problem sizes (and all implementations) tested by the executable over
      the life of a single execution. The cause of these minor
      across-the-board pertubations in the overall performance signatures is
      unknown, though we hypothesize that it may relate to any number of
      issues such as operating system scheduling, where in memory the
      program is loaded, or how the CPU clock frequency is throttled at the
      time of execution. Regardless of the source of these subtle
      performance anomalies, the statistical properties reported by the
      irun.py script help the user to more precisely characterize the
      underlying performance exhibited by any given test driver, which
      allows him or her to make better judgments about the true difference
      in performance between two implementations, or minor changes within a
      single implementation.

    Fixed confusing configure message for libmemkind.
    
    Details:
    - Corrected feedback echoed to user by configure when libmemkind is
      found but not explicitly requested. In these cases, configure would
      echo a message that it had received an explicit request to enable
      libmemkind, which was not accurate, even if the end result was the
      same--that libmemkind is enabled by default when it is found. Thanks
      To Devangi Parikh for reporting this issue.

    Various minor cleanups.
    
    Details:
    - Rewrote bli_winsys.c to define bli_setenv() and bli_sleep()
      unconditionally, but differently for Windows and non-Windows, but
      then disabled the definition of bli_setenv() entirely since BLIS
      no longer needs to set environment variables. Updated bli_winsys.h
      accordingly, and call bli_sleep() from within testsuite instead of
      sleep() directly.
    - Use
        #if !defined(_POSIX_BARRIERS) || (_POSIX_BARRIERS != 200809L)
      instead of
        #if !defined(_POSIX_BARRIERS) || (_POSIX_BARRIERS < 0)
      when guarding against local definition of pthread barrier in
      testsuite. (The description for unistd.h implies that _POSIX_BARRIERS
      should always be set to 200809L when barriers are supported, though I
      won't be surprised if we encounter a case in the future where it is
      set to something else such as 1 while still supported.)
    - Removed old _VERS_CONF_INST definitions and installation rules in
      top-level Makefile. These are no longer needed because we no longer
      output libraries with the version and configuration name as
      substrings.
    - Comment/whitespace updates in Makefile, config.mk.in, common.mk,
      configure, bli_extern_defs.h, and test_libblis.h.
    - Added mention of 1m to README.md and other trivial tweaks.

    Details:
    - Added the new bli_dgemm_skx_asm_16x14.c microkernel from the skx-redux
      branch, along with appropriate blocksizes in bli_cntx_init_skx.c and
      a prototype in bli_kernels_skx.h. (Devin has not yet written the
      sgemm analague, so for now we will continue using the older sgemm
      ukernel.)
    - Updated frame/include/bli_x86_asm_macros.h with a minor change that
      was present within the skx-redux branch.

    Employ "user" cflags for tl Makefile test targets.
    
    Details:
    - Use get-user-cflags-for() to generate cflags when compiling BLAS test
      drivers and BLIS testsuite from top-level Makefile. Meant to include
      these changes in previous commit (4b5437e). Thanks to Isuru Fernando
      for pointing out this oversight.

    Define a cpp macro specific to BLIS compilation.
    
    Details:
    - Tweaked the cflags functions in common.mk so that a new preprocessor
      macro, BLIS_IS_BUILDING_LIBRARY, is defined, but only when BLIS
      itself is being built. This macro will not be defined when, for
      example, the testsuite or example code compiles code local to those
      applications. This was done in part by defining a new cflags function
      get-user-cflags-for(), which is now the designated function for
      application Makefiles if they wish to inherit a basic set of CFLAGS
      from BLIS. (The compiler flags returned are identical to that of
      get-frame-cflags-for() except that -DBLIS_IS_BUILDING_LIBRARY is
      omitted.)
    - Updated all test driver-like makefiles to call get-user-cflags-for()
      instead of get-frame-cflags-for().

    Better thread safety; added threading to testsuite.
    
    Details:
    - Replaced critical sections that were conditional upon multithreading
      being enabled (via pthreads or OpenMP) with unconditional use of
      pthreads mutexes. (Why pthreads? Because BLIS already requires it
      for its initialization mechanism: pthread_once().) This was done in
      bli_error.c, bli_gks.c, bli_l3_ind.c. Also, replaced usage of BLIS's
      mtx_t object and bli_mutex_*() API with pthread mutexes in
      bli_thread.c. The previous status quo could result in a race condition
      if the application called BLIS from more than one thread. The new
      pthread-based code should be completely agnostic to the application's
      threading configuration. Thanks to AMD for bringing to our attention
      the need for a thread-safety review.
    - Added an option to the testsuite to simulate application-level
      multithreading. Specifically, each thread maintains a counter that is
      incremented after each experiment. The thread only executes the
      experiment if: counter % n_threads == thread_id. In other words, the
      threads simply take turns executing each problem experiment. Also,
      POSIX guarantees that fprintf() will not intermingle output, so
      output was switched to fprintf() instead of libblis_test_fprintf().
    - Changed membrk_t objects to use pthread_mutex_t intead of mtx_t and
      replaced use of bli_mutex_init()/_finalize() in bli_membrk.c with
      wrappers to pthread_mutex_init()/_destroy().
    - Changed the implementation of bli_l3_ind_oper_enable_only() to fix
      a race condition; specifically, two threads calling the function with
      the same parameters could lead to a non-deterministic outcome.
    - Added #include <pthread.h> to bli_cpuid.c and moved the same in
      bli_arch.c.
    - Added 'const' to declaration of OPT_MARKER in bli_getopt.c.
    - Added #include <pthread.h> to bli_system.h.
    - Added add-copyright.py script to automate adding new copyright lines
      to (and updating existing lines of) source files.

    Details:
    - Fixed stale filepaths to check-blastest.sh and check-blistest.sh in
      travis/do_testsuite.sh and travis/do_sde.sh.
    - Create a symbolic link to the 'config' directory so that the top-level
      Makefile can find the configs' make_defs.mk files during out-of-tree
      builds.
    - Added additional case handling to out-of-tree scenario to handle
      situations where files 'Makefile', 'common.mk', or 'config' exist but
      are not symbolic links. In such cases, configure warns the user and
      exits.
    - Homogenized various error messages throughout configure.
    - Belated thanks to Victor Eijkhout for requesting the feature added
      in 0f491e9 whereby lesser Makefiles can compile and link against
      an existing installation of BLIS.

    Allow lesser Makefiles to reference installed BLIS.
    
    Details:
    - Updated the build system so that "lesser" Makefiles, such as those in
      belonging to example code or the testsuite, may be run even if the
      directory is orphaned from the original build tree. This allows a
      user to configure, compile, and install BLIS, delete the build tree
      (that is, the source distribution, or the build directory for out-
      of-tree builds) and then compile example or testsuite code and link
      against the installed copy of BLIS (provided the example or testsuite
      directory was preserved or obtained from another source). The only
      requirement is that make be invoked while setting the
      BLIS_INSTALL_PATH variable to the same installation prefix used when
      BLIS was configured. The easiest syntax is:
    
        make BLIS_INSTALL_PATH=/install/prefix
    
      though it's also permissible to set BLIS_INSTALL_PATH as an
      environment variable prior to running 'make'.
    - Updated all lesser Makefiles to implement the new aforementioned build
      behavior.
    - Relocated check-blastest.sh and check-blistest.sh from build to
      blastest and testsuite, respectively, so that if those directories are
      copied elsewhere the user can still run 'make check' locally.
    - Updated docs/Testsuite.md with language that mentions this new option
      of building/linking against an installed copy of BLIS.

    Missing C++ compiler no longer fatal to configure.
    
    Details:
    - Changed configure so that the absence of any C++ compiler from the
      pre-defined search list does not result in an exit. Instead, in this
      situation, the found_cxx variable is assigned 'c++notfound' and the
      error message is changed to remind the user that C++ will not be
      available in the sandbox. Thanks to Devangi Parikh for reporting this
      issue.
    - Also tweaked the message when a C++ compiler *is* found to remind any
      would-be confused user that BLIS will only use C++ if it is needed by
      code in the sandbox.

    Fixed obscure integer size bug in va_arg() usage.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in the way that the variadic bli_cntx_set_l3_nat_ukrs()
      function was defined. This function is meant to take a microkernel id,
      microkernel datatype, microkernel address, and microkernel preference
      as arguments, and is typically called within the bli_cntx_init_*()
      function defined within a sub-configuration for initializing an
      appropriate context. The problem is with the final argument: the
      microkernel preference. These preferences are actually boolean values,
      0 or 1 (encoded as FALSE or TRUE). Since the variadic function does
      not give the compiler any type information for any variadic arguments,
      they are "promoted" in the course of internal (macroized) processing
      according to default argument promotion rules. Thus, integer literals
      such as 0 and 1 become int and floating-point literals (such as 0.0 or
      1.0) become double. Previous to this commit, we indicated to va_arg()
      that the ukernel preference was a 'bool_t', which is a typedef of
      int64_t on 64-bit systems. On systems where int is defined as 64 bits,
      no problems manifest since int is the same size as the type we passed
      in to va_arg(), but on systems where int is 32 bits, the ukernel
      preference could be misinterpreted as a garbage value. (This was
      observed on a modern armv8 system.) The fix was to interpret the
      bool_t value as int and then immediately typecast it to and store it
      as a bool_t. Special thanks to Devangi Parikh for helping track down
      this issue, including deciphering the use of va_arg() and its
      byzantine treatment of types.
    - Added explicit typecasts for all invocations of va_arg() in
      bli_cntx.c.

    Fixed a very minor memory leak in gks.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a memory leak in the global kernel structure that resulted in 56
      bytes per configured architecture (of which only 18 are presently
      supported by BLIS). The leak would only manifest if BLIS was
      initialized and then finalized before the application terminated.
      Thanks to Devangi Parikh for helping track down this leak.

    Fixed uncallable bli_finalize().
    
    Details:
    - Previously, bli_finalize_once()--which, like bli_init_once(), was
      implemented in terms of pthread_once()--was using the same
      pthread_once_t control object being used by bli_init(), thus
      guaranteeing that it would never be called as long as BLIS had already
      been initialized. This could manifest as a rather large memory leak to
      any application that attempted to finalize BLIS midway through its
      execution (since BLIS reserves several megabytes of storage for
      packing buffers per thread used). The fix entailed giving each
      function its own pthread_once_t object. Thanks to Devangi Parikh for
      helping track down this very quiet bug.

      non-verbose (V != 1) case.

    Fixed link error when building only shared library.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a linker error that occurred when attempting to compile and link
      the testsuite and/or BLAS test drivers after having configured BLIS to
      only generate a shared library (no static library). The chosen
      solution involved
      (1) adding the local library path, $(BASE_LIB_PATH), to the search
          paths for the shared library via the link option
          -Wl,-rpath,$(BASE_LIB_PATH).
      (2) adding a local symlink to $(BASE_LIB_PATH) that uses the .so major
          version number so that ld would find the shared library at
          execution time.
      Thanks to Sajid Ali for reporting this issue, to Devin Matthews for
      pointing out the need for the -rpath option, and to Devangi Parikh for
      helping Sajid isolate the problem.
    - Added #include <ctype.h> to bli_system.h to avoid a compiler warning
      resulting from using toupper() from bli_string.c without a prototype.
      Thanks again to Sajid Ali, whose build log revealed this compiler
      warning.
    - Added '*.so.*' to .gitignore.

    Replaced function chooser macros w/ func ptr arrays.
    
    Details:
    - Previously, most object API functions (_oapi.c) used a function
      chooser macro that would expand out to an if-elseif-elseif-else
      conditional that used a num_t datatype to call the appropriate
      type-specific API (_tapi.c). This always felt a little hackish, and
      would get in the way somewhat of addig support for new num_t datatypes
      in the future. So, I've replaced that functionality with code that
      queries a function pointer that is then typecast appropriately. This
      model of function calling was already pervasive for kernels queried
      from the cntx_t structure. It was also already in use in various other
      functions, such as macrokernels, and this commit simply extends that
      pattern.
    - The above change required many new files, mostly header files, that
      define the function types (mostly _ft.h) for the queriable functions
      as well as some source files to define the function pointer arrays and
      their corresponding query functions (_fpa.c). Various other function
      types, mostly for kernel function types, were renamed to reduce the
      potential for confusion with the function types for expert and basic
      (non-expert) typed API functions.
    - Removed definitions for all of the "bli_call_ft_*()" function chooser
      macros from bli_misc_macro_defs.h.

    Format spec and other updates in test, test/3m4m.
    
    Details:
    - Removed the dtime (delta time, or wallclock time) column from the
      matlab output of all test drivers in test, test/3m4m, test/studies.
      This value was rarely (if ever) really needed and usually only served
      to take up screen space.
    - Updated format specifier in test/studies/skx to use %7.2f instead of
      %6.3f.
    - For the test drivers in 'test' directory, added an initial line of
      output that sets last entry of matlab matrix to zero in order to
      induce a pre-allocation of the entire array of performance results.

    Adjusted gflops format spec in testsuite, test/3m4m.
    
    Details:
    - Changed the format specifier for the gflops column in the testsuite
      output from %7.3f to %7.2f. This was done mainly to keep the output
      aligned properly when the expected perfomance exceeded 1000 gflops.
      Also, two decimal places still conveys plenty of precision for all
      practical applications, including just eyeballing performance deltas
      between two executions (let alone two implementations).
    - Changed the format specifier for gflops in the test/3m4m drivers
      from %6.3f to %7.2f (for the same reasons listed above).

    Explicitly typecast return vals in static funcs.
    
    Details:
    - Added explicit typecasting to various functions (mostly static
      functions), primarily those in bli_param_macro_defs.h,
      bli_obj_macro_defs.h, bli_cntx.h, bli_cntl.h, and a few other header
      files.
    - This change was prompted by feedback from Jacob Gorm Hansen, who
      reported that #including "blis.h" from his application caused a
      gcc to output error messages (relating to types being returned
      mismatching the declared return types) when used via the C++ compiler
      front-end. This is the first pass of fixes, and we may need to
      iterate with additional follow-up commits (#233).

    Defined rntm_t to relocate cntx_t.thrloop (#235).
    
    Details:
    - Defined a new struct datatype, rntm_t (runtime), to house the thrloop
      field of the cntx_t (context). The thrloop array holds the number of
      ways of parallelism (thread "splits") to extract per level-3
      algorithmic loop until those values can be used to create a
      corresponding node in the thread control tree (thrinfo_t structure),
      which (for any given level-3 invocation) usually happens by the time
      the macrokernel is called for the first time.
    - Relocating the thrloop from the cntx_t remedies a thread-safety issue
      when invoking level-3 operations from two or more application threads.
      The race condition existed because the cntx_t, a pointer to which is
      usually queried from the global kernel structure (gks), is supposed to
      be a read-only. However, the previous code would write to the cntx_t's
      thrloop field *after* it had been queried, thus violating its read-only
      status. In practice, this would not cause a problem when a sequential
      application made a multithreaded call to BLIS, nor when two or more
      application threads used the same parallelization scheme when calling
      BLIS, because in either case all application theads would be using
      the same ways of parallelism for each loop. The true effects of the
      race condition were limited to situations where two or more application
      theads used *different* parallelization schemes for any given level-3
      call.
    - In remedying the above race condition, the application or calling
      library can now specify the parallelization scheme on a per-call basis.
      All that is required is that the thread encode its request for
      parallelism into the rntm_t struct prior to passing the address of the
      rntm_t to one of the expert interfaces of either the typed or object
      APIs. This allows, for example, one application thread to extract 4-way
      parallelism from a call to gemm while another application thread
      requests 2-way parallelism. Or, two threads could each request 4-way
      parallelism, but from different loops.
    - A rntm_t* parameter has been added to the function signatures of most
      of the level-3 implementation stack (with the most notable exception
      being packm) as well as all level-1v, -1d, -1f, -1m, and -2 expert
      APIs. (A few internal functions gained the rntm_t* parameter even
      though they currently have no use for it, such as bli_l3_packm().)
      This required some internal calls to some of those functions to
      be updated since BLIS was already using those operations internally
      via the expert interfaces. For situations where a rntm_t object is
      not available, such as within packm/unpackm implementations, NULL is
      passed in to the relevant expert interfaces. This is acceptable for
      now since parallelism is not obtained for non-level-3 operations.
    - Revamped how global parallelism is encoded. First, the conventional
      environment variables such as BLIS_NUM_THREADS and BLIS_*_NT  are only
      read once, at library initialization. (Thanks to Nathaniel Smith for
      suggesting this to avoid repeated calls getenv(), which can be slow.)
      Those values are recorded to a global rntm_t object. Public APIs, in
      bli_thread.c, are still available to get/set these values from the
      global rntm_t, though now the "set" functions have additional logic
      to ensure that the values are set in a synchronous manner via a mutex.
      If/when NULL is passed into an expert API (meaning the user opted to
      not provide a custom rntm_t), the values from the global rntm_t are
      copied to a local rntm_t, which is then passed down the function stack.
      Calling a basic API is equivalent to calling the expert APIs with NULL
      for the cntx and rntm parameters, which means the semantic behavior of
      these basic APIs (vis-a-vis multithreading) is unchanged from before.
    - Renamed bli_cntx_set_thrloop_from_env() to bli_rntm_set_ways_for_op()
      and reimplemented, with the function now being able to treat the
      incoming rntm_t in a manner agnostic to its origin--whether it came
      from the application or is an internal copy of the global rntm_t.
    - Removed various global runtime APIs for setting the number of ways of
      parallelism for individual loops (e.g. bli_thread_set_*_nt()) as well
      as the corresponding "get" functions. The new model simplifies these
      interfaces so that one must either set the total number of threads, OR
      set all of the ways of parallelism for each loop simultaneously (in a
      single function call).
    - Updated sandbox/ref99 according to above changes.
    - Rewrote/augmented docs/Multithreading.md to document the three methods
      (and two specific ways within each method) of requesting parallelism
      in BLIS.
    - Removed old, disabled code from bli_l3_thrinfo.c.
    - Whitespace changes to code (e.g. bli_obj.c) and docs/BuildSystem.md.

    Created hardware-specific test driver directory.
    
    Details:
    - Created a 'studies' subdirectory within 'test' to be used to house
       test drivers, makefiles, run scripts, matlab plot code, and related
       files that have been customized for collecting performance data on
       specific host machines or product lines. This new setup will help us
       catalog, track, and share test driver materials over time, and in a
       way that facilitates reproducibility.
    - Created an 'skx' subdirectory within 'test/studies' to house various
       level-3 test driver files used to measure performance on SkylakeX
       nodes (specifically, those nodes used by TACC's stampede2 system).

    Renamed files that distinguish basic/expert APIs.
    
    Details:
    - Renamed various files that were previously named according to a
      "with context" or "without context" convention. For example, the
      following files in frame/3 were renamed:
    
        frame/3/bli_l3_oapi_woc.c -> frame/3/bli_l3_oapi_ba.c
        frame/3/bli_l3_oapi_wc.c  -> frame/3/bli_l3_oapi_ex.c
        frame/3/bli_l3_tapi_woc.c -> frame/3/bli_l3_tapi_ba.c
        frame/3/bli_l3_tapi_wc.c  -> frame/3/bli_l3_tapi_ex.c
    
      Here, the "ba" is for "basic" and "ex" is for "expert". This new
      naming scheme will make more sense especially if/when additional
      expert parameters are added to the expert APIs (typed and object).

    Separated expert, non-expert typed APIs.
    
    Details:
    - Split existing typed APIs into two subsets of interfaces: one for use
      with expert parameters, such as the cntx_t*, and one without. This
      separation was already in place for the object APIs, and after this
      commit the typed and object APIs will have similar expert and non-
      expert APIs. The expert functions will be suffixed with "_ex" just as
      is the case for expert interfaces in the object APIs.
    - Updated internal invocations of typed APIs (functions such as
      bli_?setm() and bli_?scalv()) throughout BLIS to reflect use of the
      new explictly expert APIs.
    - Updated example code in examples/tapi to reflect the existence (and
      usage) of non-expert APIs.
    - Bumped the major soname version number in 'so_version'. While code
      compiled against a previous version/commit will likely still work
      (since the old typed function symbol names still exist in the new API,
      just with one less function argument) the semantics of the function
      have changed if the cntx_t* parameter the application passes in is
      non-NULL. For example, calling bli_daxpyv() with a non-NULL context
      does not behave the same way now as it did before; before, the
      context would be used in the computation, and now the context would
      be ignored since the interace for that function no longer expects a
      context argument.

    Added typed (BLAS-like) API code examples.
    
    Details:
    - Added new example code to examples/tapi demonstrating how to use the
      BLIS typed API. These code examples directly mirror the corresponding
      example code files in examples/oapi. This setup provides a convenient
      opportunity for newcomers to BLIS to compare and contrast the typed
      and object APIs when they are used to perform the same tasks.
    - Minor cleanups to examples/oapi.

    - Changed bli_obj_scalar_attach() so that the scalar value being attached
      is first typecast to the storage datatype of the destination object
      rather than the target datatype.
    - Reformatted function type signatures in bli_obj_scalar.c as well as
      prototypes  in its corresponding header file.

    Fixed bugs in configure's select_cc() function.
    
    Details:
    - This commit fixes several bugs in configure relating to selecting a C
      compiler. By dumb luck, two of the two bugs sort of cancelled each
      other out in most use cases, which manifested as the expected behavior.
      Thanks to Mathieu Poumeyrol for bringing this issue to our attention,
      and to Devin Matthews for suggesting the more portable way of
      capturing both stdout and stderr and suggesting a return code check
      instead of testing stdout/stderr.
    - The first bug: As the values of the compiler search list are iterated
      over, only stderr is captured when querying a compiler with --version
      rather than both stdout and stderr.
    - The second bug: After each query, a conditional attempted to test
      whether the query resulted in anything being output. That conditional
      erroneously was using "-z" instead of "-n" for non-emptiness. Thus,
      most of the time, stderr was empty (because the --version info was
      being output on stdout), and since it was empty, the -z conditional
      (intended to execute only when a compiler was found to be responsive)
      executed.
    - A third bug was also fixed in the way that the merged stdout/stderr
      output was tested for non-emptiness (moving the 'cat' invocation to
      another line and testing the contents of a variable instead).
    - The three bugs above have been fixed as part of a partial rewrite of
      the select_cc() function in terms of a return code check, which
      obviated the need to save the output of stdout and stderr.
    - The fourth bug involved a misnamed variable in the right-hand side
      of a statement intended to prepend CC to search_list when CC was
      non-empty. This typically did not manifest as a bug since usually CC
      (if it was set) was set to a value that was known to work.

    Details:
    - Any preexisting values set to the CFLAGS environment variable (or the
      CFLAGS variable if given on the command line) are saved by configure
      for later inclusion (prepending, to be precise) along with the
      compiler flags automatically determined by the BLIS build system.
      LDFLAGS is treated in a similar manner.) Thanks to Dave Love for
      requesting this feature in issue #223 and Mathieu Poumeyrol for his
      support on this and a previous related issue.
    - Comment updates to build/config.mk.in.
    - Strip whitespace from return value of various cflags functions in
      common.mk.

    - Added two presently-disabled cpp blocks in bli_cntx_init_haswell.c to

      microkernels (in the haswell subconfiguration). The second column-
      preferring block sets the the register blocksizes to their appropriate
      values. However, cache blocksizes are left unchanged, and therefore are
      likely suboptimal. This should be addressed later.

    Implemented castm, castv operations.
    
    Details:
    - Implemented castm and castv operations, which behave like copym and
      copyv except where the obj_t operands can be of different datatypes.
      These new operations, however, unlike copym/copyv, do not build upon
      existing level-1v kernels.
    - Reorganized projm, projv into a 'proj' subdirectory of frame/base (to
      match the newly added frame/base/cast directory).
    - Added new macros to bli_gentfunc_macro_defs.h, _gentprot_macro_defs.h
      that insert GENTFUNC2/GENTPROT2 macros for all non-homogeneous datatype
      combinations. Previously, one had to invoke two additional macros--one
      which mixed domains only and another that included all remaining
      cases--in order to get full type combination coverage.
    - Defined a new static function, bli_set_dims_incs_2m(), to aid in the
      setting of various variables in the implementations of bli_??castm().
      This static function joins others like it in bli_param_macro_defs.h.
    - Comment update to bli_copysc.h.

      A and B objects temporarily to communicate those desired schemas to
      the control tree creation function in blx_gemm_cntl.c. This allows us
      to (henceforth) query the schemas from the control tree rather than
      the context.

    Defined static function bli_blksz_scale_def_max().
    
    Details:
    - Added a new static function to bli_blksz.h that scales both the default
      (regular) blocksize as well as the maximum blocksize in the blksz_t
      object. Reminder: maximum blocksizes have different meanings in
      different contexts. For register blocksizes, they refer to the packing
      register blocksizes (PACKMR or PACKNR) while for cache blocksizes, they
      refer to the maximum blocksize to use during the final iteration of a
      loop.

    Changed usage of virtual microkernel slots in cntx.
    
    Details:
    - Changed the way virtual microkernels are handled in the context.
      Previously, there were query routines such as bli_cntx_get_l3_ukr_dt()
      which returned the native ukernel for a datatype if the method was
      equal to BLIS_NAT, or the virtual ukernel for that datatype if the
      method was some other value. Going forward, the context native and
      virtual ukernel slots will both be initialized to native ukernel
      function pointers for native execution, and for non-native execution
      the virtual ukernel pointer will be something else. This allows us
      to always query the virtual ukernel slot (from within, say, the
      macrokernel) without needing any logic in the query routine to decide
      which function pointer (native or virtual) to return. (Essentially,
      the logic has been shifted to init-time instead of compute-time.)
      This scheme will also allow generalized virtual ukernels as a way
      to insert extra logic in between the macrokernel and the native
      microkernel.
    - Initialize native contexts (in bli_cntx_ref.c) with native ukernel
      function addresses stored to the virtual ukernel slots pursuant to
      the above policy change.
    - Renamed all static functions that were native/virtual-ambiguous, such
      as bli_cntx_get_l3_ukr_dt() or bli_cntx_l3_ukr_prefers_cols_dt()
      pursuant to the above polilcy change. Those routines now use the
      substring "get_l3_vir_ukr" in their name instead of "get_l3_ukr". All
      of these functions were static functions defined in bli_cntx.h, and
      most uses were in level-3 front-ends and macrokernels.
    - Deprecated anti_pref bool_t in context, along with related functions
      such as bli_cntx_l3_ukr_eff_dislikes_storage_of(), now that 1m's
      panel-block execution is disabled.

    Renamed 1m packm kernels from _1e to _1er.
    
    Details:
    - Renamed the reference packm kernels used by 1m. Previously, they used
      a _1e suffix, which was confusing since they packed to both 1e and 1r
      schemas. This was likely an artifact of the time when there were
      separate kernels for each schema before I decided to combine them into
      a single function (per datatype and panel dimension), and the 1e
      functions were the ones to inherit the 1r functionality. The kernels
      have now been renamed to use a _1er suffix.

    - Implemented bli_acquire_mpart(), a general-purpose submatrix view
      function that will alias an obj_t to be a submatrix "view" of an
      existing obj_t.
    - Renumbered examples in examples/oapi and inserted a new example file,
      03obj_view.c, which shows how to use bli_acquire_mpart() to obtain
      submatrix views of existing objects, which can then be used to
      indirectly modify the parent object.

    Details:
    - Removed three input lines from input.operations.fast (labeled
      "test sequential micro-kernel") that I intended to remove in bd02c4e.
      These lines prevented 'make check' (and 'make checkblis-fast') from
      completing correctly. Note: This bug was fixed in 3df39b3, but that
      commit has not yet been merged into master, hence this redundant
      commit. Thanks to Robert van de Geijn for reporting this issue.

    Implemented bli_setrm, _setim, _setrv, _setiv.
    
    Details:
    - Defined new wrappers to setm/setv operations in frame/base/bli_setri.c
      that will target only the real or only the imaginary parts of a
      matrix/vector object.
    - Updated bli_obj_real_part() so that the complex-specific portions of
      the function are not executed if the object is real.
    - Defined bli_obj_imag_part().
      - Caveat: If bli_obj_imag_part() is called on a real object, it does
        nothing, leaving the destination object untouched. The caller must
        take care to only call the function on complex objects.
    - Reordered some of the static functions in bli_obj_macro_defs.h related
      to aliasing.

      the bli_obj_param_defs.h header file. It looks like the only consumers
      of this static function were in bli_l0_oapi.c, and so this may not have
      been manifesting (yet).

    Enforce consistent datatypes in most object APIs.
    
    Details:
    - Added logic to level-1v, -1d, -1f, -1m, -2, and -3 operations' _check()
      functions to ensure that all operands are of the same datatype. There
      are some exceptions that were left out, such as the _check() function
      for the various norm operations since they have a different idea of
      datatype consistency (ie: the norm object must be the real projection
      of the primary input vector/matrix object).

    - Added an implementation for bli_projv() to go along with the
      implementation of bli_projm() added in 0a4a27e. The only difference
      between the two is that bli_projv() may only be used on vectors,
      whereas bli_projm() is general-purpose.
    - Added a _check() function corresponding to bli_projv().

    Defined/implemented bli_projm().
    
    Details:
    - Defined a new operation in frame/base/bli_proj.c, bli_projm(), which
      behaves like bli_copym(), except that operands a and b are allowed to
      contain data of differing domains (e.g. a is real while b is complex,
      or vice versa). The file is named bli_proj.c, rather than bli_projm.c,
      with the intention that a 'v' vector version of the function may be
      added to the same file (at some point in the future).
    - Added supporting bli_check_*() functions in bli_check.c to confirm
      consistent precisions between to datatypes/objects, as well as the
      appropriate error message in bli_error.c and a new error code in
      bli_type_defs.h.
    - Wrote a bli_projm_check() function to go along with bli_projm().
    - Defined static function bli_obj_real_part() in bli_obj_macro_defs.h,
      which will initialize an obj_t alias to the real part of the source
      object.
    - Fixed a bug in the static function bli_dt_proj_to_complex(), found
      in bli_param_macro_defs.h. Thankfully, there were no calls to the
      function to produce buggy behavior.

    - Removed "test sequential front-end" lines from microkernel test
      entries of input.operations.fast. This change was meant for inclusion
      in bd02c4e but was missed due to slightly different wording of the
      comment (I used "sed //d" to remove the lines). This fixes the broken
      'make checkblis-fast' (and 'make check') targets.

      was formulated as "ifeq ($(MK_ENABLE_MEMKIND),yes)". That is, the
      variable being empty was effectively equivalent to it being set to
      "no".

    Cleanups to testsuite, input.operations format.
    
    Details:
    - Removed the line in each operation entry in input.operations titled
      "test sequential front-end" and the corresponding support for the lines
      in the testsuite input parsing code. This line was included in the some
      of the earliest versions of the testsuite, back when I intended to
      eventually have separate multithreaded APIs. Specifically, I envisioned
      that multithreaded and sequential testing could be enabled or disabled
      on an operation level. However, BLIS evolved in a different direction
      and still does not have multithreaded-specific APIs (even if it will
      eventually someday). But even if it did have such APIs, I doubt I would
      allow the user to enable/disable them on an operation level. Thus, this
      was a zombie future parameter that was never used and never made sense
      to begin with. The one instance of the front_seq variable, used in the
      various libblis_test_<operation>() functions to guard the call to the
      operation test driver, that remains was commented out instead of
      deleted so that someday it could be easily changed via sed, if desired.
    - Various minor cleanups to the testsuite code, including consolidating
      use of DISABLE and DISABLE_ALL and reexpressing certain conditional
      expressions in the libblis_test_<operation>() functions in terms of
      boolean functions.

    Updated setting/querying pack schema (cntx->cntl).
    
    - Query pack schemas in level-3 bli_*_front() functions and store those
      values in the schema bitfields of the correponding obj_t's when the
      cntx's method is not BLIS_NAT. (When method is BLIS_NAT, the default
      native schemas are stored to the obj_t's.)
    - In bli_l3_cntl_create_if(), query the schemas stored to the obj_t's in
      bli_*_front(), clear the schema bitfields, and pass the queried values
      into bli_gemm_cntl_create() and bli_trsm_cntl_create().
    - Updated APIs for bli_gemm_cntl_create() and bli_trsm_cntl_create() to
      take schemas for A and B, and use these values to initialize the
      appropriate control tree nodes. (Also cpp-disabled the panel-block cntl
      tree creation variant, bli_gemmpb_cntl_create(), as it has not been
      employed by BLIS in quite some time.)
    - Simplified querying of schema in bli_packm_init() thanks to above
      changes.
    - Updated openmp and pthreads definitions of bli_l3_thread_decorator()
      so that thread-local aliases of matrix operands are guaranteed, even
      if aliasing is disabled within the internal back-end functions (e.g.
      bli_gemm_int.c). Also added a comment to bli_thrcomm_single.c
      explaining why the extra aliasing is not needed there.
    - Change bli_gemm() and level-3 friends so that the operation's ind()
      function is called only if all matrix operands have the same datatype,
      and only if that datatype is complex. The former condition is needed
      in preparation for work related to mixed domain operands, while the
      latter helps with readability, especially for those who don't want to
      venture into frame/ind.
    - Reshuffled arguments in bli_cntx_set_thrloop_from_env() to be
      consistent with BLIS calling conventions (modified argument(s) are
      last), and updated all invocations in the level-3 _front() functions.
    - Comment updates to bli_cntx_set_thrloop_from_env().

    Cleanups to ref99/README.md, test/3m4m/Makefile.
    
    Details:
    - Minor edits to sandbox/ref99/README.md.
    - Removed cpp guards in sandbox/ref99/thread/blx_gemm_thread.h to be
      consistent with other headers in sandbox/ref99.
    - Additional targets and related cleanups in test/3m4m/Makefile.

    Renamed "next micropanel" macros in _l3_thrinfo.h.
    
    Details:
    - Renamed several macros defined in bli_l3_thrinfo.h designed to compute
      the values of a_next and b_next to insert into an auxinfo_t struct in
      level-3 macrokernels. (Previously, the macros did not use a bli_
      prefix.)
    - Updated instances of above macro usage within various macrokernels.

    Test all x86_64 configurations*... (#212)
    
    * Add custom SDE cpuid files.
    
    * Set up testing of all x86_64 architectures (except bulldozer) using SDE.
    
    * Update .travis.yml
    
    [ci skip]
    
    * Update do_testsuite.sh
    
    [ci skip]
    
    * Updated .travis.yml with my secret token.
    
    Details:
    - Replaced Devin's temporary secret token with my own, which is used by
      Travis when accessing the Intel SDE via Dropbox.
    
    * Work around CPUID dispatch in glibc/libm by patching ld.so.
    
    * Detect path of loader at runtime.
    
    * Attempt to make SDE run on Travis
    
    * Allow unpatched ld.so if we don't know how to patch it.
    
    I *think* this only happens for older glibc without the multi-arch stuff (e.g. Ubuntu 14.04 on Travis), but who knows?
    
    * Upgrade Travis to gcc-6 and binutils-2.26.
    
    * Try to get Travis to use the right assembler.
    
    * Apparently you need ld-2.26 too.
    
    * Try to also patch ld.so from Ubuntu 14.04.
    
    * Take the nuclear option.
    
    * Account for non-absolute dependencies in ldd output.
    
    * String manipulation fail.
    
    * Update patch-ld-so.py
    
    * Add Zen to SDE testing.
    
    * Removed dead variable from travis/do_testsuite.sh.
    
    Details:
    - Removed 'BLIS_ENABLE_TEST_OUTPUT=yes' from make invocations in
      travis/do_testsuite.sh. This variable is no longer present in the
      BLIS build system (if it ever was?), and therefore has no effect.

    - Renamed sandbox/c99 to sandbox/ref99. I wanted to name the sandbox so
      that it would be thought of as a "reference" sandbox. I kept the "99"
      to differientiate it from future reference sandboxes that may be
      written in another language (such as C++).

    Details:
    - Added a c99 sandbox (in sandbox/c99) to serve as a starting point for
      others looking to experiment with alternative implementations of gemm
      in BLIS. Note that this sandbox implementation is a first draft and
      will be refined over time.
    - Minor updates to Makefile and common.mk to restrict what source files
      get recompiled when sandbox files are touched.
    - Added an initial draft of a README.md in sandbox/c99.

    Support alternative gemm implementation sandboxes.
    
    Detail:
    - configure:
      - add support for --enable-sandbox=NAME to configure script, where NAME
        is a subdirectory of a new 'sandbox' directory that contains an
        alternative implementation of gemm. (For now, only implementations of
        gemm may be provided via a sandbox.);
      - add support for C++ compiler. C++ compilers are handled in a manner
        similar to that of C compilers, in that a default search order is
        used, and that CXX is searched for first, if the variable is set. In
        practice, the C++ compiler that is selected should correspond to the
        selected C compiler. (Example: If gcc is selected for C, g++ should
        be selected for C++.) The result of the search is output to config.mk
        via build/config.mk.in. NOTE: The use of C++ in BLIS is still
        hypothetical, but may eventually move to being experimental. This
        support was intended only for use of C++ within a gemm sandbox.
    - build/config.mk.in:
      - define SANDBOX variable containing sandbox subdirectory name.
    - build/bli_config.in:
      - define either of the BLIS_ENABLE_SANDBOX or BLIS_DISABLE_SANDBOX
        macros in bli_config.h.
    - common.mk:
      - include makefile fragments that were propagated into the specified
        sandbox subdirectory;
      - generate different CFLAGS for sandboxes, as well as a separate
        CXXFLAGS variable for sandboxes when C++ source files are compiled;
      - isolate into a single location lists of file suffixes for various
        purposes.
      - reorganized/clean up code related to identifying header files and
        paths.
    - Makefile:
      - generate object filepaths for and compile source code files found in
        sandbox sub-directory;
      - remove makefile fragments placed in sandbox sub-directory (cleanmk);
      - various other cleanups.
    - Added .cc, .cpp, and .cxx to list of suffixes of files to recognize in
      makefile fragments (via build/gen-make-frags/suffix_list).
    - Updated blis.h to conditionally #include bli_sandbox.h (via a new file,
      bli_sbox.h), which each sandbox is assumed to use for any type
      definitions and function prototypes it wishes to export out to blis.h.
    - Conditionally disable bli_gemmnat() implementation in frame/3 when
      BLIS_ENABLE_SANDBOX is defined.

    Updated types of bli_is_[un]aligned_to() functions.
    
    Details:
    - Changed the void* arguments of the following static functions:
        bli_is_aligned_to()
        bli_is_unaligned_to()
        bli_offset_past_alignment()
      to siz_t, and the return type of bli_offset_past_alignment() from
      guint_t to siz_t. This allows for more versatile usage of these
      functions (e.g. when aligning both pointers and leading dimension).
    - Updated all invocations of these functions, mostly in kernels/penryn
      but also in kernels/bgq, to include explicit typecasts to siz_t when
      pointer arguments are passed in.
    - Thanks to Devin Matthews for pointing out this potential bug (via issue
      #211).
    - Deleted a few trailing spaces in various penryn kernels.
    - Removed duplicate instances of the words "derived" and "THEORY" from
      various kernel license headers, likely from a malformed recursive sed
      performed long ago.

    - Updated file-level copyright notices to include a comma, to match
      the formatting used for UT and AMD copyrights.

    Cache hardware's arch_t id after querying once.
    
    Details:
    - Added logic to bli_arch.c that will call what was previously the body
      of bli_arch_query_id() only once and then cache the value in a static
      variable local to the file. (Previously, the arch_t associated with
      the hardware/configuration was queried every time bli_arch_query_id()
      was called, which was at least once per level-3 function call. Thanks
      to Devin Matthews for suggesting this feature via issue #175.
    - Added -lpthread to the compile/link command line of the compiler
      invocation that compiles build/detect/config/config_detect.c, which
      prints the string identifying the detected configuration, since it
      is now needed due to new pthread_once() logic in bli_arch.c.
    - Implementation note: I chose to implement this arch_t caching feature
      via pthread_once(), using a separate pthread_once_t variable local to
      the file, rather than calling bli_init_once(). The reason is that I
      did not want to require bli_init() as a prerequisite to this function.
      bli_init() already calls several sub-components, some of which make use
      of bli_arch_query_id(), and therefore it would be easy to fall into a
      circular self-init situation (which usually causes pthreads to hang
      indefinitely).

    Fixed clobber list bug in ARMv8 ukernel

    Inserted missing integer typecasting into ukernels.
    
    Details:
    - Inserted missing safeguards into most microkernels to ensure that the
      integers read by the microkernel's assembly instructions are of the
      appropriate size. In many cases, this bug was going undetected likely
      because the compiler was inserting zero padding before the integers
      in the calling function, allowing the assembly code to read 64-bits
      in a way that did not corrupt the "lower" 32 integer bits with garbage
      in the higher bits. Thanks to Francisco Igual and Devangi Parikh for
      finding this issue.

Author: Field G. Van Zee <field@cs.utexas.edu>
Date:   Wed May 16 12:46:57 2018 -0500

    Fixed a bug in determining default integer size.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug that would cause configurations to inadvertantly define
      their integers to be 32 bits when those environments actually call for
      64-bit integers. While either BLIS_ARCH_64 or BLIS_ARCH_32 is defined
      in bli_system.h (based on whether preprocessor macros such as __x86_64
      or __aarch64__ are defined by the environment), bli_system.h was being
      #included *after* bli_config_macro_defs.h, in which the BLIS_ARCH_64
      macro was used to choose an integer type size in the event that
      BLIS_INT_TYPE_SIZE was not already defined by configure via
      bli_config.h. And due to the structure of the cpp code in that file,
      the 32-bit integer case was being chosen. Thanks to Francisco Igual
      and Devangi Parikh for their help in isolating this bug.
    - Moved the #include of hbwmalloc.h and related preprocessor code to
      bli_kernel_macro_defs.h to facilitate the reshuffling of the #include
      for bli_system.h in blis.h.

    Fix shared library builds on platforms other than Linux and macOS (#209)
    
    * Fix detection of systems other than Linux and macOS
    
    The way the logic is currently laid out, any platform that isn't Linux
    gets assigned the .dylib shared library extension and the macOS-specific
    compiler flags. This reverses the logic to check for macOS first, and
    have the fallback use the Linux definitions, which apply to most other
    systems as well.
    
    * Use SHLIB_EXT instead of SO_SUF
    
    The former is more standard, as jakirkham pointed out in a comment.

    Communicate cc, cc_vendor to make via config.mk.
    
    Details:
    - Historically, the compiler selection has happened statically in the
      various make_defs.mk and would only be overriden by setting CC (either
      prior to running configure or as a configure argument). However, in
      the last couple months, configure has evolved to contain rather
      sophisticated compiler detection logic for the purposes of blacklisting
      sub-configurations. It only makes sense that configure now fully take
      over the responsibility of selecting a compiler from the GNU make side
      of the build system. Thanks to Alex Arslan for his help exposing this
      issue.
    - Substitute found_cc into CC in config.mk via configure.
    - Set a new variable, CC_VENDOR, in config.mk via substitution from
      configure, and disable the corresponding CC_VENDOR code in common.mk.
    - Disabled default compiler selection (usually gcc) in the sub-configs'
      various make_def.mk files.

    Change compiler search order on OpenBSD.
    
    Details:
    - Set a compiler search list (and order) as a function of the OS detected
      via 'uname -s'. By default, this list and order is 'gcc clang cc' for
      Linux and Darwin (OS X), and any other OS except OpenBSD). On OpenBSD,
      we use 'cc gcc clang' because OpenBSD's default installation of gcc
      (4.2.1) is too old for BLIS. Thanks to Alex Arslan for reporting this
      issue and suggesting a fix.

    Better handling of shared libraries on OS X.
    
    Details:
    - Use the .dylib shared library suffix on OS X (instead of .so in Linux).
    - Link with the -dynamiclib and -install_name options on OS X (instead of
      -shared and -soname in Linux).
    - Determine operating system (e.g. Linux, Darwin) during configure and
      substitute into config.mk.in rather than run 'uname -s' during make.
    - Echo operating system during configure.

    Enable building shared library by default.
    
    Details:
    - Tweaked configure so that the shared library is generated by default.
    - Updated --help text and configure's feedback messages reporting the
      status of the static/shared builds.
    - Changed the order of build product installation so that headers are
      installed last, after libraries and symlinks.

    Adopt Linux-like .so versioning at install-time.
    
    Details:
    - Changed the naming conventions used for installed libraries and
      symlinks to more closely mirror patterns used by typical GNU/Linux
      libraries. Whereas previously static and shared libraries were
      installed and symlinked as follows:
    
        (library) libblis-0.3.2-15-haswell.a
        (library) libblis-0.3.2-15-haswell.so
        (symlink) libblis.a -> libblis-0.3.2-15-haswell.a
        (symlink) libblis.so -> libblis-0.3.2-15-haswell.so
    
      we now use the following naming conventions:
    
        (library) libblis.a
        (symlink) libblis.so -> libblis.so.0.1.2
        (symlink) libblis.so.0 -> libblis.so.0.1.2
        (library) libblis.so.0.1.2
    
      where 0.1.2 indicates shared library major, minor, and build versions
      of 0, 1, and 2, respectively. The conventional version string can
      still be queried by linking to the library in question and then calling
      bli_info_get_version_str(). (The testsuite binary does this
      automatically at startup.)
    - Added logic to common.mk to set the soname field in the shared library
      via the -soname linker flag.
    - Added a 'so_version' file to the top-level directory containing two
      lines. The first line specifies the .so major version number, and the
      second line specifies the minor and build version numbers joined with
      a '.'. This file is read by configure and those values substituted
      into build/config.mk.in to define SO_MAJOR, SO_MINORB, and SO_MMB
      variables.

    Tweaks to top-level clean and distclean targets.
    
    Details:
    - Moved the removal of bli_config.h from cleanh to distclean.
    - Removed cleantest as a dependency of clean.

    Renamed (shortened) a few build system variables.
    
    Details:
    - Renamed the following variables in config.mk (via build/config.mk.in):
        BLIS_ENABLE_VERBOSE_MAKE_OUTPUT -> ENABLE_VERBOSE
        BLIS_ENABLE_STATIC_BUILD        -> MK_ENABLE_STATIC
        BLIS_ENABLE_SHARED_BUILD        -> MK_ENABLE_SHARED
        BLIS_ENABLE_BLAS2BLIS           -> MK_ENABLE_BLAS
        BLIS_ENABLE_CBLAS               -> MK_ENABLE_CBLAS
        BLIS_ENABLE_MEMKIND             -> MK_ENABLE_MEMKIND
      and also renamed all uses of these variables in makefiles and makefile
      fragments. Notice that we use the "MK_" prefix so that those variables
      can be easily differentiated (such as via grep) from their "BLIS_" C
      preprocessor macro counterparts.
    - Other whitespace changes to build/config.mk.in.
    - Renamed the following C preprocessor macros in bli_config.h (via
      build/bli_config.h.in):
        BLIS_ENABLE_BLAS2BLIS        -> BLIS_ENABLE_BLAS
        BLIS_DISABLE_BLAS2BLIS       -> BLIS_DISABLE_BLAS
        BLIS_BLAS2BLIS_INT_TYPE_SIZE -> BLIS_BLAS_INT_TYPE_SIZE
      and also renamed all relevant uses of these macros in BLIS source
      files.
    - Renamed "blas2blis" variable occurrences in configure to "blas", as
      was done in build/config.mk.in and build/bli_config.h.in.
    - Renamed the following functions in frame/base/bli_info.c:
        bli_info_get_enable_blas2blis() -> bli_info_get_enable_blas()
        bli_info_get_blas2blis_int_type_size()
                                        -> bli_info_get_blas_int_type_size()
    - Remove bli_config.h during 'make cleanh' target of top-level Makefile.

    Converted function-like macros to static functions.
    
    Details:
    - Converted most C preprocessor macros in bli_param_macro_defs.h and
      bli_obj_macro_defs.h to static functions.
    - Reshuffled some functions/macros to bli_misc_macro_defs.h and also
      between bli_param_macro_defs.h and bli_obj_macro_defs.h.
    - Changed obj_t-initializing macros in bli_type_defs.h to static
      functions.
    - Removed some old references to BLIS_TWO and BLIS_MINUS_TWO from
      bli_constants.h.
    - Whitespace changes in select files (four spaces to single tab).

Date:   Mon May 7 18:59:19 2018 -0500

    Add configure support for --libdir, --includedir.
    
    Details:
    - Added support for two new configure options: --libdir and --includedir.
      They specify the precise install directories for libraries and header
      files, respectively, and override any location implied by the --prefix
      option (including the default install prefix, if --prefix was not
      given). Thanks to Nico Schlömer for suggesting this via issue #195.
    - Removed the INSTALL_PREFIX definition/anchor from build/config.mk.in
      and replaced it with corresponding definitions/anchors for libdir and
      includedir.
    - Updated top-level Makefile to use the new variables, INSTALL_LIBDIR
      and INSTALL_INCDIR, instead of INSTALL_PREFIX (which is now no longer
      needed by make).
    - Set default sane values for INSTALL_LIBDIR and INSTALL_INCDIR in
      common.mk when configure has not been run, as is already done for
      DIST_PATH. This is to safeguard against statements in the top-level
      Makefile that use 'find' to locate old libraries and headers for the
      uninstall targets, which run regardless of make target. Without setting
      INSTALL_LIBDIR and INSTALL_INCDIR, those variables are empty and the
      'find' ends up looking at '/', which is obviously not what we want.
      (Also enclosed those definitions in an IS_CONFIGURED guard so that they
      won't get evaluated unless configure has been run.)
    - Rearranged "ifeq ($(IS_CONFIGURED),yes)" conditionals in Makefile to
      reduce occurrences and separated "local" and top-level components of
      cleanblastest and cleanblistest targets to improve readability.
    - Adjusted out-of-tree builds so that they are no longer oblivious to
      the .git directories, if present, and thus now properly augment version
      strings with the appropriate patch number.
    - Include missing version string in 'configure --help' output.

Date:   Mon May 7 14:37:50 2018 -0500

    Allow 'make clean' and friends without configuring.
    
    Details:
    - Modified top-level Makefile so that a user can run 'make distclean',
      'make clean', or any of the other clean-related targets prior to
      running configure (or after a previous 'make distclean'). Thanks to
      Nico Schlömer for suggesting this via issue #197.
    - Made the cleanblastest and cleanblistest more comprehensive in that
      they now clean out build products that would have resulted from local
      compilation (ie: builds performed within the 'blastest' or 'testsuite'
      directories).
    - Added "cc" to list of expected compiler "vendors" since the CC variable
      seems to automatically be set to "cc" on Ubuntu 16.04 (which is just an
      alias to gcc).
    - Comment update to build/config.mk.in.

    No longer update version file during configure.
    
    Details:
    - Recycled the core functionality of build/update-version-file.sh into a
      function in configure, disabling the updating of the 'version' file in
      the process. Instead of writing the patched version string back to the
      version file and then reading it again from within configure, the
      patched version string is now saved directly to a variable in the main()
      function in configure. This will prevent developers from accidentally
      committing configure-induced changes to the version file in between
      releases.

    AMD specific optimizations for target 'zen' (#194)
    
    Re-enabled AMD-specific optimizations for zen.
    
    Details:
    - Re-enabled Zen-specific cache blocksizes for 'zen' sub-configuration.
    - Re-enabled small matrix gemm optimization for 'zen'.
    - These were both temporarily disabled during a previous merge simply due to lack of Zen hardware for testing.

    Add setijm, getijm operations.
    
    Details:
    - Added bli_setgetijm.c, which defines bli_setijm(), bli_getijm(), and
      related functions that can be used to read and write individual
      elements of an obj_t.
    - Defined a new function, bli_obj_create_conf_to(), in bli_obj.c that will
      create a new object with dimensions conformal to an existing object.
      Transposition and conjugation states on the existing object are ignored,
      as are structure and uplo fields.
    - Defined a new function, bli_datatype_string(), in bli_obj.c that returns
      a char* to a string representation of the name of each num_t datatype.
      For example, BLIS_DOUBLE is "double" and BLIS_DCOMPLEX is "dcomplex".
      BLIS_INT is included (as "int"), but BLIS_CONSTANT is not, and thus is
      not a valid input argument to bli_datatype_string().
    - Added calls to bli_init_once() to various functions in bli_obj.c, the
      most important of which was bli_obj_create_without_buffer().

    Added RELEASING file.
    
    Details:
    - Added a file named 'RELEASING' that contains basic notes on how to
      create a new version/release of BLIS. This is mostly just a reminder
      to myself, but also may become useful if/when others take over
      development and administration of the project.

    Updates to knl kernels and related code.
    
    Details:
    - Imported the 24x16 knl sgemm microkernel (and its corresonding spackm
      kernel) from TBLIS and enabled its use in the knl sub-config. Also
      Added sgemm microkernel prototype to bli_kernels_knl.h.
    - Updated dgemm and dpackm microkernels from TBLIS, which included an
      important change regarding the offsets array (changed from extern
      declaration to static declaration/definition).
    - Activated use of level-1v and -1f zen kernels in skx and knl
      sub-configs.
    - Removed some old macros no longer needed in bli_family_skx.h now that
      libmemkind support exists in configure.
    - Moved bli_avx512_macros.h to frame/include and adjusted #includes in
      skx and knl kernels accordingly.
    - Moved unused kernels in kernels/knl/3 to kernels/knl/3/other
      directory.
    - Fixed a minor bug in the 'make' output per compile when verboseness
      is not turned on. The rule-generating function 'make-kernel-rule' was
      previously passing in the name of the config, rather than the name of
      the kernel set returned by get-config-for-kset, which could give
      misleading information to the user when the kconfig_map mapped a
      kernel set to a sub-configuration that did not share the same name.
      (This didn't affect the CFLAGS that were actually used.)
    - Updated test/3m4m/Makefile, removing acml targets and renaming the
      remaining targets.

    Retired haswell gemm microkernels.
    
    Details:
    - Moved microkernels in kernels/haswell/3 to kernels/haswell/3/old. These
      microkernels were no longer being used and only sowed confusion to
      anyone inspecting the repository without being fully cognizant of the
      build system and how it works (and sometimes even to those who wrote
      the build system). Note that the haswell configuration currently
      employs the zen microkernels.

    Details:
    - Swiched from querying version of 'objdump' to 'as' (e.g. the
      assembler).
    - Fixed the outputting of the version of 'as' on OS X, which required
      this beauty:
        ...=$(as -v /dev/null -o /dev/null 2>&1)
    - Only add sub-configs to blacklist if the sub-config hasn't already
      been added.

    Added support for blacklisting via the assembler.
    
    Details:
    - Added logic to configure that attempts to assemble various small files
      containing select instructions designed to reveal whether binutils
      (specifically, the assembler) supports emitting those instruction sets.
      This information provides additional opportunities to blacklist sub-
      configurations that are unsupported by the environment. Thanks to Devin
      Matthews for pointing me towards a similar solution in TBLIS as an
      example.
    - Various other cleanups in configure.
    - Reorganized the detection code in the 'build' directory, bringing the
      "auto-detect" configuration detection, libmemkind detection, and new
      instruction set detection codes into a single new subdirectory named
      'detect'.

    Fixed failure to honor CC= argument to configure.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a failure to observe the value of CC when selecting the compiler
      in configure. Thanks to Devangi Parikh for reporting this bug.
    - The semantics now also work for the CC environment variable. That is,
      if CC is set prior to running configure, that value is used, but will
      be overridden by specifying the CC= argument to configure. If the CC
      environment variable is not set, the CC= value is used. If neither the
      environment variable nor CC= are specified, then the choice is made
      internally to configure: first attempting to find gcc, then clang, and
      then cc.

    Fixed libmemkind dependency for x86_64.
    
    Details:
    - Removed some old conditional code in config/knl/make_defs.mk that
      added -lmemkind to LDFLAGS if DEBUG_TYPE was not 'sde' and inserted
      code into common.mk that affirmatively filters out -lmemkind from
      LDFLAGS if DEBUG_TYPE is 'sde'. (Thanks to Dave Love for reporting
      this issue.) Other minor cleanups to neighboring code in common.mk.
    - Updated CRVECFLAGS in knl/make_defs.mk to be based on -march=knl,
      and then AVX-512 functionality is manually removed via various
      -mno-avx512* flags. Also, make the setting of CRVECFLAGS conditional
      on CC_VENDOR. Similar change to skx/make_defs.mk.
    - Comment/whitespace updates.

    Track separate ref kernel flags for each sub-config.
    
    Details:
    - Renamed CVECFLAGS variables in sub-configurations' make_defs.mk files
      to CKVECFLAGS.
    - Added default defintions of two new make variables to most sub-
      configurations' make_defs.mk files--CROPTFLAGS and CRVECFLAGS--
      which correspond to reference kernel analogues of the CKOPTFLAGS
      and CKVECFLAGS, which track optimization and vectorization flags for
      optimized kernels. Currently, two sub-configurations (knl and skx)
      explicitly set CRVECFLAGS to non-default values (using AVX2 instead of
      AVX-512 for reference kernels. Thanks to Jeff Hammond, whose feedback
      prompted me to make this change (issue #187).
    - Changed common.mk so that the get-refkern-cflags-for function returns
      the flags associated with the given sub-configuration's CROPTFLAGS
      and CRVECFLAGS (instead of CKOPTFLAGS and CKVECFLAGS).

    De-verbosify makefile fragment generation.
    
    Details:
    - Changed from -v1 to -v0 when calling gen-make-frag.sh from configure.
      The directory-by-directory recursive output didn't add much value to
      the user, so now we just echo a line for each top-level directory into
      which we will recurse (e.g. 'config', 'ref_kernels', 'frame', etc.).
      This also helps keep more interesting information (from earlier in the
      execution of configure) from scrolling out of the terminal window.

    Added 64-bit integer support to BLAS test drivers.
    
    Details:
    - Updated the build system and BLAS test drivers to use 64-bit integers
      when BLIS is configured for 64-bit integers in the BLAS layer. Also
      updated blastest/Makefile accordingly. Thanks to Dave Love for
      reporting the need for this feature.
    - Added a 'check' target to blastest/Makefile so that the user can see
      a summary of the tests.
    - Commented out the initial definition of INCLUDE_PATHS in common.mk,
      which was used pre-monolithic header, back when BLIS needed paths to
      *all* headers, rather than just a select few. This line is no longer
      needed since the value of INCLUDE_PATHS is overwritten by a later
      definition limited to only the header paths that are needed now.

    Adjusted CFLAGS used to compile bli_cntx_ref.c.
    
    Details:
    - Removed CKOPTFLAGS and CVECFLAGS from the set of CFLAGS used to
      compile bli_cntx_ref.c for each configuration. This is necessary
      because the file defines functions like bli_cntx_init_skx_ref(),
      which are called during BLIS's initialization of the global kernel
      structure, potentially being executed by an architecture that lacks
      the instruction set used to compile the kernels for, in this example,
      skx, which would lead to an illegal instruction error. Thanks to
      Dave Love for reporting this issue.
    - Further adjusted CFLAGS used when compiling code in the 'config'
      directory (e.g. bli_cntx_init_skx.c) as well as code in 'frame' so
      as to avoid the aforementioned issue.

    Added color-coding to 'make check' output.
    
    Details:
    - Added color coding to output of check-blistest.sh, check-blastest.sh
      scripts. Success messages are coded green and failure are coded red.
      This helps draw the eye toward those messages as the 'make checkblis',
      'make checkblis-fast', and 'make checkblas' targets are executed.
    - Changed top-level Makefile so that execution will not halt if
      'checkblis', 'checkblis-fast', or 'checkblas' targets fail, which
      means that the second of the two tests (BLIS and BLAS) run by
      'make check' will run even if the first test fails.

    Added skx, knl to x86_64 configuration family.
    
    Details:
    - Added 'skx' and 'knl' sub-configurations to the 'x86_64' configuration
      family in the config_registry file.
    - Added logic to configure that avoids committing certain sub-configs to
      the configuration/kernel registries if those sub-configs cannot be
      handled properly by the chosen compiler. (This was modeled after
      similar logic in TBLIS's configure; thanks to Devin Matthews for
      pointing this out.) First, the compiler and its version are inspected
      and, based on the results, certain configurations are added to a
      "blacklist". Then, as the configuration registries are being created,
      configurations and/or kernels that match items in the blacklist are
      skipped over and not commited to the registries. Under certain
      circumstances, omitting a blacklisted configuration will indirectly
      invalidate other configurations due to the loss of availability of
      the original blacklisted configuration's kernel set. This additional
      indirect blacklist is also accounted for.
    - Added output to the beginning of configure that echos information
      about the chosen compiler as well as the configurations that are
      blacklisted and must be stripped from the registries.
    - Various other cleanups in configure, especially with respect to
      explicitly declaring local variables in functions.
    - Comment updates to config/zen/make_defs.mk regarding choice of -march
      flags based on compiler version.

    Fixed 64b type mismatch warning in cblas_xerbla.c.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a compiler warning concerning a type mismatch between the
      format specifier of the printf() call in cblas_xerbla.c and its
      corresponding (info) argument. The warning manifested when the CBLAS
      layer was enabled and the BLAS/CBLAS integer type siwas is set to 64
      (the default is 32). The warning was fixed by changing the specifier
      from %d to %jd and typecasting the argument to intmax_t. Thanks to
      Dave Love for reporting this issue and submitting the patch.

    Row storage optimizations to zen dotxf kernels.
    
    Details:
    - Split the main loop bodies of zen's [sd]dotxf kernels into two cases:
      one to handle a column-stored matrix A and one to handle a row-stored
      matrix A. This allows vector instructions to be employed even if A is
      stored by rows (and A^T appears stored as columns). Both storage cases
      use a common edge case loop. Thanks to Devin Matthews for this idea
      and for prototyping the change needed for sdotxf kernel.

      from dim_t to uint64_t. This is needed to ensure compatibility with
      the movq instruction used to load the value into registers. This
      change should have been made a long time ago, but for some reason
      only recently began showing up via Travis CI.

    Fixed a memkind-related compile-time bug on knl.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a compile-time error that occurred due to the fact that
      BLIS_ENABLE_MEMKIND, defined in bli_config.h, was not being defined
      soon enough to be used in bli_system.h where it is needed to determine
      whether hbwmalloc.h should be #included. bli_system.h is now included
      after bli_config.h (and bli_config_macro_defs.h). Thanks to Dave Love
      for reporting this issue.
    - Tweaked the language used by configure to echo the status of the
      --with[out]-memkind option.

    Removed vzeroupper intrinsics from zen kenels.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in the zen (also used by haswell) dotxf kernels whereby a
      vzeroupper instruction destoryed part of the intermediate result
      stored by the vdpps instructions that came right before. (The
      vzeroupper instrinsic was removed.)
    - Removed remaining vzeroupper instrinsics from other zen kernels.
      Previously, the vzeroupper instructions were included because BLIS is
      typically compiled with -mfpmath=sse. But it was brought to my
      attention that inserting these vzeroupper instructions is unnecessary
      for our purposes, since (a) -mfpmath=sse results in VEX-encoded scalar
      code rather than literal SSE instructions, and (b) compilers already
      (likely) insert vzeroupper instructions where necessary. Thanks to
      Devin Matthews for zeroing in on the dotxf bug.
    - Removed -malign-double from bulldozer make_defs.mk. This alignment
      was already happening by default since bulldozer is an x86_64 system.

    Added build system support for libmemkind.
    
    Details:
    - Added support for libmemkind to configure. configure attempts to
      detect the presence of libmemkind by compiling a small program
      containing #include <hbwmalloc.h> and a call to hbw_malloc(). If
      successful, it is assumed that libmemkind is present and available.
      If present, use of libmemkind is enabled by default, and otherwise
      use is disabled by default. If libmemkind is present, the user may
      explicitly disable use of the library by running configure with the
      --without-memkind option. Furthermore, a configuration may disable
      libmemkind, perhaps conditional on some aspect of the build system,
      by including -DBLIS_DISABLE_MEMKIND in the configuration's CPPROCFLAGS
      make variable and setting the BLIS_ENABLE_MEMKIND makefile variable,
      set in config.mk, to 'no'. (The knl configuration makes use of this
      latter feature; see below.)
    - If enabled at configure-time, bli_system.h will #include <hbwmalloc.h>
      and bli_kernel_macro_defs.h will define BLIS_MALLOC_POOL and
      BLIS_FREE_POOL to use hbw_malloc() and hbw_free(), respectively.
    - Deprecated explicit use of BLIS_NO_HBWMALLOC in
      config/knl/bli_family.knl.h and replaced use of -DBLIS_NO_HBWMALLOC in
      config/knl/make_defs.mk with -DBLIS_DISABLE_MEMKIND, which overrides
      (#undefs) the definition of BLIS_ENABLE_MEMKIND in bli_system.h, if it
      would otherwise be defined. Also, set the BLIS_ENABLE_MEMKIND makefile
      variable to 'no'.
    - common.mk now adds libmemkind to LDFLAGS if libmemkind is enabled.

    Updates to top-level and test driver Makefiles.
    
    Details:
    - Added logic to common.mk that will choose a BLIS library against which
      to link (LIBBLIS_LINK). The default choice is the static (.a) library;
      the shared (.so) library is chosen only if the shared library build was
      enabled and the static one was disabled.
    - Updated the various test driver Makefiles to reference this common,
      pre-chosen library against which to link. (Previously, these drivers
      unconditionally linked against the static library and would have
      failed if the static library build was disabled at configure-time.)
    - Renamed many of the variables in common.mk and the top-level Makefile
      so that variables relating to the libblis.[a|so] files, including
      paths to those files, begin with "LIBBLIS".
    - Shuffled around some of the library definitions from the top-level
      Makefile to common.mk.
    - Renamed BLIS_ENABLE_DYNAMIC_BUILD to BLIS_ENABLE_SHARED_BUILD, and
      the @enable_dynamic@ anchor to @enable_shared@ in build/config.mk.in
      and in configure.
    - A few other cleanups in the top-level Makefile.

    Added input.operations.fast file for 'make check'.
    
    Details:
    - Added an 'input.operations.fast' file to testsuite directory to go
      along with the 'input.general.fast' file used by the 'make check'
      target in the top-level Makefile. This will allow the "fast" check
      to prune operations and/or parameter combinations from the test
      space in order to save time.
    - Currently, input.operations.fast prunes trmm3 and all transposition
      and conjugation parameters from the level-3 test space.
    - Reduced problem size tested in input.general.fast to 100 and disabled
      testing of 1m method.

      testsuite in testsuite/obj.)

    Details:
    - Invoke the full BLIS testsuite via 'make testblis' instead of the fast

      fast traget is 'testblis-fast').
    - Invoke the BLAS tests via 'make testblas' instead of 'blastest'.

    Integrated f2c'ed netlib BLAS test suite.
    
    Details:
    - Created a new test suite that exercises only the BLAS compatibility
      found in BLIS. The test suite is a straightforward port of code
      obtained from netlib LAPACK, run through f2c and linked to a stripped-
      down version of libf2c that is compiled along with the test drivers
      (to prevent any obvious ABI issues). The new BLAS test suite can be
      run from within its new local directory, 'blastest' (through its local
      'make ; make run' targets) or from the top-level Makefile (via the
      'make testblas' target). Output files are created in whatever directory
      the test drivers are run, whether it be the 'blastest' directory, the
      top-level source distribution directory, or the out-of-tree directory
      in which 'configure' was run. Also, the results of the BLAS test suite
      can be checked via 'make checkblas', which summarizes the presence or
      absence of test failures in a single line printed to stdout.
    - Updated the 'test' target to run both 'testblis' and 'testblas'.
    - Added a new 'testblis-fast' target that runs the BLIS testsuite with
      smaller problem sizes, allowing it to finish more quickly.
    - Added a 'make check' target, which runs 'checkblis-fast' and
      'checkblas'.
    - Changed .travis.yml so that Travis CI runs 'testblis-fast' instead of
      'testblis' before (calling the check-blistest.sh script to check the
      result manually).
    - Renamed some targets in the top-level Makefile to be consistent between
      BLAS and BLIS.

    Fixed a few obscure bugs in the BLAS API.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a missing parameter in the definition of sdsdot_(). The 'sb'
      argument was missing. Strangely, the argument is omitted from dsdot_()
      in the BLAS API.
    - Fixed the missing 'c' or 'u' in the "?gerc" or "?geru" operation string
      passed to xerbla_() by the bla_ger_check() macro.
    - For bla_syrk_check() and bla_syr2k_check() macros, only allow
      conjugate-transpose (trans='c') as a valid argument for the real
      domain functions [sd]syrk_() and [sd]syr2k_(). (Previously, the
      argument was allowed even for the complex domain equivalents, which
      was inconsistent with the BLAS API.)

    Fixed cpp macro parameter "ch" typo in bla_ger.c.
    
    Details:
    - Previously, the BLAS routine-generating macro in bla_ger.c was
      incorrectly passing MKSTR(ch) into the _check() macro when it
      should have been passing in the char that was available, chxy.
      I've instead changed the name of the macro parameter from chxy
      to ch. Similar change as made to bla_ger.h for consistency.
      Thanks to Dave Love in helping track this down. (NOTE: This is
      actually the root cause of the bug that was first patched by
      increasing the length of the operation name strings passed into
      xerbla_(), as defined by the constant BLIS_MAX_BLAS_FUNC_STR_LENGTH,
      in 3d1a5a7. In theory, that change could be backed out now.)
    - Applied aforementioned chxy->ch change to bla_dot.[ch], as well as
      frame/compat/cblas/f77_sub/f77_dot_sub.[ch] (not because it needed
      to happen, but for naming consistency).
    - Reformatted function signatures/prototypes of CBLAS functions and
      function calls to BLAS in frame/compat/cblas/f77_sub/*.c.

    Convert op names to uppercase before calling xerbla_().
    
    Details:
    - Defined a new function, bli_string_mkupper(), that calls toupper() on
      every non-NULL character in a string.
    - Call bli_string_mkupper() prior to calling xerbla_() in the level-2/-3
      BLAS _check() macros. This prevents the BLAS testsuite from complaining
      that the operation name (e.g. "dgemm") does not match the expected
      value (e.g. "DGEMM"). Thanks to Dave Love for reporting this issue.

    Fixed printf() format overflow.
    
    Details:
    - Increased the length of operation name strings passed to xerbla_() in
      the level-2 and level-3 operation _check() functions, found in
      frame/compat/check. This avoids a format specifier overflow warning by
      gcc 7. Thanks to Dave Love for reporting this issue and suggesting the
      fix.

    Return after non-zero info in BLAS checks.
    
    Details:
    - Previously, when calling the BLAS compatibility layer, discovering a
      parameter check failure would result in the proper setting of the
      info parameter (printed by xerbla_()), but would also come with an
      immediate abort() rather than a return. This was incorrect behavior
      for two overlapping reasons.
      (1) BLAS should return gracefully to the caller in the event of a
          bad set of parameters, not abort().
      (2) When BLIS was being tested via the BLAS testsuite, BLIS's
          xerbla_() would correctly get preempted/overridden by the
          xerbla_() in the BLAS testsuite, but execution would then
          erroneously continue on to the BLIS implementation with bad
          parameter values.
    - The previous issue was addressed by disabling the abort() in BLIS's
      xerbla_(), changing all of the BLAS _check() functions to cpp macros,
      and adding a return statement to the end of each _check() macro's
      "if ( info != 0 )" conditional.
      Thanks to Dave Love for reporting this issue.

    Minor typo fix to printing arch in testsuite.
    
    Details:
    - Mistakenly was calling bli_cpuid_query_id() instead of
      bli_arch_query_id() in the recent addition to the testsuite output
      that prints the active sub-configuration. The former function is
      only used for multi-architecture builds, whereas the latter is the
      more general option that also works for single configuration
      (including 'configure auto') builds.

    Print sub-configuration name in testsuite output.
    
    Details:
    - Added a line to the testsuite output that prints the name of the
      current/active sub-configuration. This is useful when linking the
      testsuite against multi-configuration builds because it confirms
      the sub-configuration that is actually being employed at runtime.
      Thanks to Devin Matthews for suggesting this feature.

    Allow arbitrarily deep configuration families.
    
    Details:
    - Updated configure so that configuration families specified in the
      config_registry are no longer constrained as being only one level
      deep. For example, previously the x86_64 family could not be defined
      concisely in terms of, say, intel64 and amd64 families, and instead
      had to be defined as containing "haswell, sandybridge, penryn, zen,
      etc." In other words, families were constrained to only having
      singleton configurations as their members. That constraint is now
      lifted.
    - Redefined x86_64 family in config_registry in terms of intel64 and
      amd64.

    Updates to ARM hardware detection support.
    
    Details:
    - Updated/clarified the ARM preprocessor macro branch of bli_cpuid.c.
      Going forward, cortexa57 (64-bit), cortexa15, and cortexa9 (32-bit)
      sub-configurations are supported. However, the functions that detect
      features specific to a15 and a9 are identical, and since a15 is tested
      first, it will always be chosen for arm32 hardware (even if both
      sub-configurations were enabled at configure-time and the library is
      linked and run on an a9). Thus, more work needs to be done to
      distinguish these two.
    - Added cpp guard around x86_64 portions of bli_cpuid.c. Now, either
      the x86_64 or ARM code will be compiled (or neither, if neither
      environment is detected).
    - In bli_arch_query_id(), call bli_cpuid_query_id() when the
      BLIS_FAMILY_ARM64 or BLIS_FAMILY_ARM32 macros are defined.
    - Added arm64 and arm32 configuration families to config_registry.
    - Added a note to the arch_t typedef enum in bli_type_defs.h reminding
      the developer to update the string array in bli_arch.c whenever new
      enum values are added or existing values are reordered.

    Fixed missing flags during shared object build.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in common.mk that caused warning, position-independent
      code, miscellaneous, and general preprocessor flags to be omitted
      from the configuration family-specific variables that hold those
      values, as registered by the family's make_defs.mk file. This would
      most obviously manifest when targeting a configuration family such as
      'intel64' while simultaneously configuring for a shared object build,
      as the key '-fPIC' flag would be omitted at compile-time and prevent
      successful linking. Thanks to Dave Love for reporting this bug.
    - Other cleanups to common.mk for readability and clarity.

      were tripping. Thanks for Dave Love for reporting this issue.
    - Switch knl sub-configuration to use default blocksizes for datatypes
      not supported by native kernels.
    - Fixed typos in bli_error.c that prevented certain error strings
      (which report maximum cache blocksizes not being multiples of their
      corresponding register blocksize) from properly initializing.

      easy to revert back to the previous combination of operation tests.
    - Added more comments to input.operations describing the use of
      individual "enable only" overrides.

    - Register use of level-1v zen intrinsic kernels for amaxv, axpyv, dotv,
      dotxv, and scalv, as well asl level-1f zen intrinsic kernels for axpyf
      and dotxf. This works because these kernels simply target AVX/AVX2,
      and therefore work without modification on haswell hardware.
    - Switch to use of zen microkernels in bli_cntx_init_haswell.c. The zen
      kernels are essentially identical to those used by haswell, except that
      now zen kernels are a bit more up-to-date. In the future, I may
      continue to maintain duplicates, or I may keep the kernels named after
      one architecture (zen or haswell) but used by both sub-configurations.
    - In config_registry, enable use of both haswell and zen kernels for the
      haswell sub-configuration. This is necessary in order to make zen
      kernels visible when registering kernels in bli_cntx_init_haswell.c.
    - Enable use of assembly-based complex gemm microkernels for zen,
      bli_cgemm_zen_asm_3x8() and bli_zgemm_zen_asm_3x4(), in
      bli_cntx_init_zen.c. This was actually intended for 1681333.

    Applied 34b72a3 to non-active/unused microkernels.
    
    Details:
    - Applied the read-beyond-bounds bugfix in 34b72a3 to other haswell and
      zen kernels (ie: other microtile shapes) which are not used by default.
      This was done mostly in case someone decided to pick up these kernels
      and start using them, not because it affects BLIS's behavior
      out-of-the-box.

    Fixed obscure read-beyond-bounds bug in sgemm ukrs.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed an obscure bug in the bli_sgemm_haswell_asm_6x16 and
      bli_sgemm_zen_asm_6x16 microkernels when the input/output matrix C
      is stored with general stride (ie: both rs and cs are non-unit). The
      bug was rooted in the way those microkernels read from matrix C--
      namely, they used vmovlps/vmovhps instead of movss. By loading two
      floats at a time, even if one of them was treated as junk, the
      assembly code could be written in a more concise manner. However,
      under certain conditions--if m % mr == 0 and n % nr == 0 and the
      underlying matrix is not an internal "view" into a larger matrix--
      this could result in the very last vmovhps of the last (bottom-right)
      microkernel invocation reading beyond valid memory. Specifically, the
      low 32 bits read would always be valid, but the high 32 bits could
      reside beyond the bounds of the array in which the output C matrix is
      contained. To remedy this situation, we now selectively use movss to
      load any element that could be the last element in the matrix.

    Added missing 'restrict' to some kernels' cntx_t*.
    
    Details:
    - Added missing 'restrict' keyword to cntx_t* argument of function
      signatures corresponding to level-1v, level-1f, and level-1m kernels.
      This affected bli_l1v_ker_prot.h, bli_l1f_ker_prot.h, and
      bli_l1m_ker_prot.h. (The 'restrict' was already being used to
      qualify cntx_t* arguments for kernels defined in bli_l3_ker_prot.h.)
    - Added comments to bli_l1v_ker.h, bli_l1f_ker.h, bli_l1m_ker.h, and
      bli_l3_ukr.h that help explain how those headers function to produce
      kernel prototypes using the prototype macros defined in the files
      mentioned above.

    Merge branch 'amd' into rt
    
    Details:
    - Merged contributions made by AMD via 'amd' branch (see summary below).
      Special thanks to AMD for their contributions to-date, especially with
      regard to intrinsic- and assembly-based kernels.
    - Added column storage output cases to microkernels in
      bli_gemm_zen_asm_d6x8.c and bli_gemmtrsm_l_zen_asm_d6x8.c. Even with
      the extra cost of transposing the microtile in registers, this is
      much faster than using the general storage case when the underlying
      matrix is column-stored.
    - Added s and d assembly-based zen gemmtrsm_u microkernel (including
      column storage optimization mentioned above).
    - Updated zen sub-configuration to reflect presence of new native
      kernels.
    - Temporarily reverted zen sub-configuration's level-3 cache blocksizes
      to smaller haswell values.
    - Temporarily disabled small matrix handling for zen configuration
      family in config/zen/bli_family_zen.h.
    - Updated zen CFLAGS according to changes in 1e4365b.
    - Updated haswell microkernels such that:
      - only one vzeroupper instruction is called prior to returning
      - movapd/movupd are used in leiu of movaps/movups for double-real
        microkernels. (Note that single-real microkernels still use
        movaps/movups.)
    - Added kernel prototypes to kernels/zen/bli_kernels_zen.h, which is
      now included via frame/include/bli_arch_config.h.
    - Minor updates to bli_amaxv_ref.c (and to inlined "test" implementation
      in testsuite/src/test_amaxv.c).
    - Added early return for alpha == 0 in bli_dotxv_ref.c.
    - Integrated changes from f07b176, including a fix for undefined
      behavior when executing the 1m method under certain conditions.
    - Updated config_registry; no longer need haswell kernels for zen
      sub-configuration.
    - Tweaked marginal and pass thresholds for dotxf.
    - Reformatted level-1v, -1f, and -3 amd kernels and inserted additional
      comments.
    - Updated LICENSE file to explicitly mention that parts are copyright
      UT-Austin and AMD.
    - Added AMD copyright to header templates in build/templates.
    
    Summary of previous changes from 'amd' branch.
    - Added s and d assembly-based zen gemm microkernels (d6x8 and d8x6) and
      s and d assembly-based zen gemmtrsm_l microkernels (d6x8).
    - Added s and d intrinsics-based zen kernels for amaxv, axpyv, dotv, dotxv,
      and scalv, with extra-unrolling variants for axpyv and scalv.
    - Added a small matrix handler to bli_gemm_front(), with the handler
      implemented in kernels/zen/3/bli_gemm_small_matrix.c.
    - Added additional logic to sumsqv that first attempts to compute the
      sum of the squares via dotv(). If there is a floating-point exception
      (FE_OVERFLOW), then the previous (numerically conservative) code is
      used; otherwise, the result of dotv() is square-rooted and stored as
      the result. This new implementation is only enabled when FE_OVERFLOW
      is #defined. If the macro is not #defined, then the previous
      implementation is used.
    - Added axpyv and dotv standalone test drivers to test directory.
    - Added zen support to old cpuid_x86.c driver in build/auto-detect/old.
    - Added thread-local and __attribute__-related macros to bli_macro_defs.h.

Author: Field G. Van Zee <field@cs.utexas.edu>
Date:   Thu Feb 15 18:36:54 2018 -0600

    Fixed an obscure bug in the 1m implementation.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in the way the bli_gemm1m_cntx_ref() function (defined in
      ref_kernels/bli_cntx_ref.c) initializes its context for 1m execution.
      Previously, the function probed the context that was in the process of
      being updated for use with 1m--this context being previously
      initialized/copied from a native context--for its storage preference
      to determine which "variant" (row- or column-oriented) of 1m would be
      needed. However, the _cntx_ref() function was not updating the method
      field of the context until AFTER this query, and the conditional which
      depended on it, had taken place, meaning the storage preference query
      function would mistakenly think the context was for native execution,
      since the context's method field would still be set to BLIS_NAT. This
      would lead it to incorrectly grab the storage preference of the complex
      domain microkernel rather than the corresponding real domain
      microkernel, which could cause the storage preference predicate to
      evaluate to the wrong value, which would lead to the _cntx_ref()
      function choosing the wrong variant. This could lead to undefined
      behavior at runtime. The method is now explicitly set within the
      context prior to calling the storage preference query function.
    - Updated comments in frame/ind/oapi/bli_l3_3m4m1m_oapi.c.
    - Fixed a typo in the commented-out CFLAGS in config/zen/make_defs.mk,
      which are appropriate for gcc 6.x and newer. (Mistakenly used
      -march=bdver4 instead of -march=znver1.)

    Document how to enable zen-specific instructions.
    
    Details:
    - Added as a comment in config/zen/make_defs.mk the list of compiler flags
      that could be added to manually enable the instructions provided by the
      Zen microarchitecture that are not already implied by -march=bdver4.
      This information, along with the previous commit's flags to selectively
      disable Bulldozer instructions no longer present in Zen, was gathered
      from [1]. I hesitate to enable use of these instructions since I don't
      have any Zen hardware to test on yet.

    Augment zen CFLAGS to prevent illegal instruction.
    
    Details:
    - Added various compiler flags (-mno-fma4 -mno-tbm -mno-xop -mno-lwp) so
      that compiling with -march=bdver4 on zen-based architectures does not
      result in an illegal instruction error at runtime. Note: This fix is
      only needed for gcc 5.4; gcc 6.3 or later supports the use of
      -march=znver1, which can be used in lieu of the augmented set of flags
      based on bdver4. Thanks to Nisanth Padinharepatt for reporting this
      error.

    - Print the name of the configuration in the output of the
      kernel-to-config map (and chosen pairs list) as a subtle way to remind
      the user that these only apply to the targeted configuration (whereas
      the config list and kernel list are printed without regard to which
      configuration was actually targeted).

      when deciding whether or not to update the version file prior to
      configuration.

    Intelligently select compiler for auto-detection.
    
    Details:
    - Rewrote code that selects the compiler for the purposes of compiling
      the auto-detection executable. CC (if specified) is tried first. Then
      gcc. Then clang. The absolute fallback is cc. The previous code was
      sort of broken, and seemed to unintentionally always use gcc.
    - Moved various configuration-agnostic flags from config/*/make_defs.mk
      files to common.mk. The new mechanism appends the configuration-
      agnostic flags to the various compiler flag variables initialized in
      make_defs.mk. Flags specific to the sub-configuration are still set
      in make_defs.mk.
    - Added -Wno-tautological-compare to CMISCFLAGS when clang is in use.
      Also added the flag to the compiler instantiation during configure-
      time hardware detection (when clang is selected).
    - Added some missing (but mostly-optional) quotes to configure script.

    Reimplemented configure-time hardware detection.
    
    Details:
    - Reimplemented the hardware detection functionality invoked when running
      "./configure auto". Previously, a standalone script in build/auto-detect
      that used CPUID was used. However, the script attempted to enumerate all
      models for each microarchitecture supported. The new approach recycles
      the same code used for runtime hardware detection introduced in 2c51356.
      This has two immediate benefits. First, it reduces and consolidates the
      code required to detect microarchitectures via the CPUID instruction.
      Second, it provides an indirect way of testing at configure-time the
      code that is used to detect hardware at runtime. This code is (a) only
      activated when targeting a configuration family (such as intel64 or
      amd64) at configure-time and (b) somewhat difficult to test in
      practice, since it relies on having access to older microarchitectures.
    - The above change required placing conditional cpp macro blocks in
      bli_arch.c and bli_cpuid.c which either #include "blis.h" or #include
      a bare-bones set of headers that does not rely on the presence of a
      bli_config.h header. This is needed because bli_config.h has not been
      created yet when configure-time auto-detection takes places.
    - Defined a new function in bli_arch.c, bli_arch_string(), which takes
      an arch_t id and returns a pointer to a string that contains the
      lowercase name of the corresponding microarchitecture. This function
      is used by the auto-detection script to printf() the name of the
      sub-configuration corresponding to the detected hardware.

Date:   Thu Dec 21 19:22:57 2017 -0600

    Added option to disable pack buffer memory pools.
    
    Details:
    - Added a new configure option, --[en|dis]able-packbuf-pools, which will
      enable or disable the use of internal memory pools for managing buffers
      used for packing. When disabled, the function specified by the cpp
      macro BLIS_MALLOC_POOL is called whenever a packing buffer is needed
      (and BLIS_FREE_POOL is called when the buffer is ready to be released,
      usually at the end of a loop). When enabled, which was the status quo
      prior to this commit, a memory pool data structure is created and
      managed to provide threads with packing buffers. The memory pool
      minimizes calls to bli_malloc_pool() (i.e., the wrapper that calls
      BLIS_MALLOC_POOL), but does so through a somewhat more complex
      mechanism that may incur additional overhead in some (but not all)
      situations. The new option defaults to --enable-packbuf-pools.
    - Removed the reinitialization of the memory pools from the level-3
      front-ends and replaced it with automatic reinitialization within the
      pool API's implementation. This required an extra argument to
      bli_pool_checkout_block() in the form of a requested size, but hides
      the complexity entirely from BLIS. And since bli_pool_checkout_block()
      is only ever called within a critical section, this change fixes a
      potential race condition in which threads using contexts with different
      cache blocksizes--most likely a heterogeneous environment--can check
      out pool blocks that are too small for the submatrices it wishes to
      pack. Thanks to Nisanth Padinharepatt for reporting this potential
      issue.
    - Removed several functions in light of the relocation of pool reinit,
      including bli_membrk_reinit_pools(), bli_memsys_reinit(),
      bli_pool_reinit_if(), and bli_check_requested_block_size_for_pool().
    - Updated the testsuite to print whether the memory pools are enabled or
      disabled.

    Modest performance boost to flatten-headers.py.
    
    Details:
    - Updated flatten-headers.py to pre-compile the main regular expression
      used to isolate #include directives and the header filenames they
      reference. The compiled regex object is then used over and over on
      each header file in the tree of referenced headers. This appears to
      have provided a 1.7-2x performance increase in the best case.
    - Other minor tweaks, such as renaming the main recursive function from
      replace_pass() to flatten_header().

    - Added flatten-headers.py, a python implementation of the bash script
      flatten-headers.sh. The new script appears to be 25-100x faster,
      depending on the operating system, filesystem, etc. The python script
      abides by the same command line interface as its predecessor and
      targets python 2.7 or later. (Thanks to Devin Matthews for suggesting
      that I look into a python replacement for higher performance.)
    - Activated use of flatten-headers.py in common.mk via the FLATTEN_H
      variable.
    - Made minor tweaks to flatten-headers.sh such as spelling corrections
      in comments.

    Allow travis failures of OS X builds that run testsuite.
    
    Details:
    - Added an allowance for OS X builds that run the testsuite to fail.
      There seems to be an issue with 1m when running in Travis CI under
      OS X and clang, but only in double-precision. Haven't been able to
      reproduce the error on my own, and thus, I can't debug it. (Hopefully
      it is simply a version-specific compiler bug.)

    Fixed testsuite Makefile brokenness from 9091a207.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a makefile error encountered when building the testsuite directly
      in its directory (as opposed to indirectly via 'make test'). The fix
      involves introducing a new variable, BUILD_PATH, alongside the existing
      DIST_PATH variable. By default, BUILD_PATH is set to the current
      directory, and is overridden by other Makefiles used by, for example,
      the testsuite and standalone test drivers in testsuite or test,
      respectively.
    - Some files/directories in common.mk were redefined in terms of
      BUILD_DIR, such as the locations of config.mk file and the intermediate
      include directory.

    Simplified/fixed self-initialization.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a race condition in self-initialization whereby the bli_is_init
      static variable could be erroneously read as TRUE by thread 1 while
      thread 0 is still executing bli_init_apis(), thus allowing thread 1 to
      use the library before it is actually ready. Thanks to to Minh Quan Ho
      and Devin Matthews for pointing out this issue.
    - Part of the solution to the aforementioned race condition was involved
      replacing the runtime initialization of the global scalar constants
      (e.g., BLIS_ONE, BLIS_ZERO, etc.) in bli_const.c with a static
      initialization of those same constants. This eliminates the need for
      bli_const_init() altogether. (The static initialization is made concise
      via preprocess macros.)
    - Defined bli_gks_query_cntx_noinit(), which behaves just like
      bli_gks_query_cntx(), except that it does not call bli_init_once(). This
      function is called in lieu of bli_gks_query_cntx() in bli_ind_init() and
      bli_memsys_init() so as to not result in any recursion into
      bli_init_once().
    - Removed BLIS_ONE_HALF, BLIS_MINUS_ONE_HALF global scalar constants.
      They have no use in BLIS or its test products, and we have little reason
      to believe they are used by others.
    - Removed testsuite/out file, which was accidentally committed as part
      of 70640a3.

    Added temp_dir argument to flatten-headers.sh.
    
    Details:
    - Added "temp_dir" argument to flatten-headers.sh so that the caller can
      specify where intermediate files should be created as the script runs.
    - Updated flatten-headers.sh to create intermediate files in temp_dir
      instead of alongside the corresponding source files. This should now
      (once again) allow out-of-tree builds where the BLIS distribution is
      read-only, or where the out-of-tree build is running concurrently with
      another out-of-tree build. (Thanks to Devin Matthews for pointing out
      the possibility of simultaneous out-of-tree builds.)

    Further attempt to fix out-of-tree builds.
    
    Details:
    - Fix applied in 87978f6 was necessary but not sufficient to fix
      out-of-tree builds. It turns out that using a source tree that had
      already built the target erroneously gave the impression that
      out-of-tree builds were working again, when in fact they were still
      broken. The additional changes in this commit should complete the
      fix that was started in the aforementioned commit. Thanks to Devin
      Matthews and Shaden Smith for their help in isolating this issue.

Author: Field G. Van Zee <field@cs.utexas.edu>
Date:   Mon Dec 11 17:18:43 2017 -0600

    Implemented library self-initialization.
    
    Details:
    - Defined two new functions in bli_init.c: bli_init_once() and
      bli_finalize_once(). Each is implemented with pthread_once(), which
      guarantees that, among the threads that pass in the same pthread_once_t
      data structure, exactly one thread will execute a user-defined function.
      (Thus, there is now a runtime dependency against libpthread even when
      multithreading is not enabled at configure-time.)
    - Added calls to bli_init_once() to top-level user APIs for all
      computational operations as well as many other functions in BLIS to
      all but guarantee that BLIS will self-initialize through the normal
      use of its functions.
    - Rewrote and simplified bli_init() and bli_finalize() and related
      functions.
    - Added -lpthread to LDFLAGS in common.mk.
    - Modified the bli_init_auto()/_finalize_auto() functions used by the
      BLAS compatibility layer to take and return no arguments. (The
      previous API that tracked whether BLIS was initialized, and then
      only finalized if it was initialized in the same function, was too
      cute by half and borderline useless because by default BLIS stays
      initialized when auto-initialized via the compatibility layer.)
    - Removed static variables that track initialization of the sub-APIs in
      bli_const.c, bli_error.c, bli_init.c, bli_memsys.c, bli_thread, and
      bli_ind.c. We don't need to track initialization at the sub-API level,
      especially now that BLIS can self-initialize.
    - Added a critical section around the changing of the error checking
      level in bli_error.c.
    - Deprecated bli_ind_oper_has_avail() as well as all functions
      bli_<opname>_ind_get_avail(), where <opname> is a level-3 operation
      name. These functions had no use cases within BLIS and likely none
      outside of BLIS.
    - Commented out calls to bli_init() and bli_finalize() in testsuite's
      main() function, and likewise for standalone test drivers in 'test'
      directory, so that self-initialization is exercised by default.

    Details:
    - Fixed implicit typecasting of conj_t to trans_t in bli_[un]packm_cxk.c.
    - Properly typecast integer arguments to match format specifier in various
      calls to printf() in bli_l3_thrinfo.c, bli_cntx.c, bli_pool.c, and
      bli_util_oapi.c.
    - Fixed "unsigned less-than-comparison with zero" checks in bli_check.c,
      bli_cntx.h.
    - Fixed mis-typed enums in bli_cntx.c (e.g., l1mkr_t that should have been
      l1fkr_t or l1vkr_t).
    - Fixed instances of opid_t value BLIS_GEMM that should have been l3ukr_t
      value BLIS_GEMM_UKR in bli_cntx_ref.c.
    - NOTE: These issues were identified via compiler warnings when building
      BLIS with clang on a rather old installation of OS X:

      it would seem to allow for insufficient starting address alignment for

    Thread Safety: Move bli_init() before and bli_finalize() after main()
    
    BLIS provides APIs to initialize and finalize its global context.
    One application thread can finalize BLIS, while other threads
    in the application are stil using BLIS.
    
    This issue can be solved by removing bli_finalize() from API.
    One way to do this is by getting bli_finalize() to execute by default
    after application exits from main().
    
    GCC supports this behaviour with the help of __attribute__((destructor))
    added to the function that need to be executed after main exits.
    
    Similarly bli_init() can be made to run before application enters main()
    so that application need not call it.

    Thread safety: Make the global induced method status array local to thread
    
    BLIS retains a global status array for induced methods, and provides
    APIs to modify this state during runtime. So, one application thread
    can modify the state, before another starts the corresponding
    BLIS operation.
    
    This patch solves this issue by making the induced method status array
    local to threads.

    Fixed bugs in gemm/gemmtrsm ukr tests in testsuite.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in gemmtrsm test module that was due to improper partitioning
      into a k x k triangular matrix for the purposes of obtaining an mr x k
      micropanel of A with which to test.
    - Fixed a bug in gemm and gemmtrsm test modules that would only manifest for
      very large k (depending on the product of mr x kc on that architecture).
      The bug arose from the fact that the test module was triggering the
      allocation of blocks from the internal memory pools, which are limited in
      size. This allocation imposes an implicit assumption that the micro-
      panel being tested with will fit inside, and this assumption is violated
      for large values of k. Arbitrarily large k may now be tested for both
      operation tests.
    - Added OpenMP/pthread critical sections around the setting or getting of
      statuses from the induced method operation lookup table in bli_l3_ind.c.
    - Added the 'static' keyword to all pthread_mutex_t global variables in BLIS.
    - Thanks to Nisanth Padinharepatt of AMD for reporting the first and third
      issues.

    Details:
    - Removed trailing commas from enums in bli_type_defs.h. Thanks to
      Erling Andersen for pointing out this inconsistency and suggesting
      the change.

    Added edge handling to _determine_blocksize_b().
    
    Details:
    - Added explicit handling of situations where i == dim to
      bli_determine_blocksize_b_sub(). This isn't actually needed by any
      current use case within BLIS, but handling the situation is nonetheless
      prudent. Thanks to Minh Quan for reporting this issue and requesting
      the fix.

    Fixed a minor bug in level-3 packm management.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in bli_l3_packm() that caused cntl_t-cached packed mem_t
      entries to be released and then re-acquired unnecessarily. (In essence,
      the "<" operands in the conditional that guards the
      release-and-reacquire code block simply needed to be swapped.) The bug
      should have only affected performance (rather than the computed result).
      Thanks to Minh Quan for identifying and reporting the bug.

    Moved 'family' field from cntx_t to cntl_t.
    
    Details:
    - Removed the family field inside the cntx_t struct and re-added it to the
      cntl_t struct. Updated all accessor functions/macros accordingly, as well
      as all consumers and intermediaries of the family parameter (such as
      bli_l3_thread_decorator(), bli_l3_direct(), and bli_l3_prune_*()). This
      change was motivated by the desire to keep the context limited, as much
      as possible, to information about the computing environment. (The family
      field, by contrast, is a descriptor about the operation being executed.)
    - Added additional functions to bli_blksz_*() API.
    - Added additional functions to bli_cntx_*() API.
    - Minor updates to bli_func.c, bli_mbool.c.
    - Removed 'obj' from bli_blksz_*() API names.
    - Removed 'obj' from bli_cntx_*() API names.
    - Removed 'obj' from bli_cntl_*(), bli_*_cntl_*() API names. Renamed routines
      that operate only on a single struct to contain the "_node" suffix to
      differentiate with those routines that operate on the entire tree.
    - Added enums for packm and unpackm kernels to bli_type_defs.h.
    - Removed BLIS_1F and BLIS_VF from bszid_t definition in bli_type_defs.h.
      They weren't being used and probably never will be.

    Updated ar option list used by all configurations.
    
    Details:
    - Dropped 'u' from the list of modifiers passed into the library archiver
      ar. Previously, "cru" was used, while now we employ only "cr". This
      change was prompted by a warning observed on Ubuntu 16.04:
    
        ar: `u' modifier ignored since `D' is the default (see `U')
    
      This caused me to realize that the default mode causes timestamps to be
      zero, and thus the 'u' option, which causes only changed object files to
      be inserted, is not applicable.

    Added --force-version=STRING option to configure.
    
    Details:
    - Added an option to configure that allows the user to force an arbitrary
      version string at configure-time. The help text also now describes the
      usage information.
    - Changed the way the version string is communicated to the Makefile.
      Previously, it was read into the VERSION variable from the 'version' file
      via $(shell cat ...). Now, the VERSION variable is instead set in
      config.mk (via a configure-substituted anchor from config.mk.in).

    Updated openmp/pthread barriers with GNU atomics.
    
    Details:
    - Updated the non-tree openmp and pthreads barriers defined in
      bli_thrcomm_openmp.c and bli_thrcomm_pthreads.c to instead call a common
      implementation in bli_thrcomm.c, bli_thrcomm_barrier_atomic(). This new
      implementation goes through the same motions as the previous codes, but
      protects its loads and increments with GNU atomic built-ins. These atomic
      statements take memory ordering parameters that allow us to specify just
      enough constraints for the barrier to work as intended on weakly-ordered
      hardware. The prior implementation was only guaranteed to work on systems
      with strongly- ordered memory. (Thanks to Devin Matthews for suggesting
      this change and his crash-course in atomics and memory ordering.)
    - Removed 'volatile' from structs' barrier field declarations in
      bli_thrcomm_*.h.
    - Updated bli_thrcomm_pthread.? files to use renamed struct barrier fields
      consistent with that of the _openmp.? files.
    - Updated other bli_thrcomm_* files to rename "communicator" variables to
      simply "comm".

    Added API to set mt environment variables.
    
    Details:
    - Renamed bli_env_get_nway() -> bli_thread_get_env().
    - Added bli_thread_set_env() to allow setting environment variables
      pertaining to multithreading, such as BLIS_JC_NT or BLIS_NUM_THREADS.
    - Added the following convenience wrapper routines:
        bli_thread_get_jc_nt()
        bli_thread_get_ic_nt()
        bli_thread_get_jr_nt()
        bli_thread_get_ir_nt()
        bli_thread_get_num_threads()
        bli_thread_set_jc_nt()
        bli_thread_set_ic_nt()
        bli_thread_set_jr_nt()
        bli_thread_set_ir_nt()
        bli_thread_set_num_threads()
    - Added #include "errno.h" to bli_system.h.
    - This commit addresses issue #140.
    - Thanks to Chris Goodyer for inspiring these updates.

    Fixed a bug in norm1v, norm1m.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug that manifested as improperly-computed 1-norm for vectors
      and matrices. This is one of the few operations in BLIS that does not
      have its own test module within the testsuite, hence why it went
      undetected for so long. The bad 1-norms were being used to normalize
      matrices in the testsuite after initialization, which led to some
      matrices containing a combination of "large" and "small" values. This
      tended to push the residuals computed after each test away from zero.
      In some cases, they were off *just* enough to the testsuite to label
      it a "failure". Many thanks to Jeff Hammond for reporting this bug.
      (Wonky details: the bug was due to improperly-defined level-0 scalar
      macros for abval2, an operation that computes the absolute square,
      or complex magnitude/modulus. Certain complex domain instances of
      abval2 were being incorrectly defined in terms of real-only solutions,
      leading to bad results. This level-0 operation forms the basis of
      norm1v/norm1m. absq2 was also affected, but almost nothing uses
      this operation.)

      anyone manually running the testsuite using default test parameters.

    allow KNL build without hbwmalloc.h (i.e. emulated)
    
    we want to be able to run BLIS KNL binaries on non-KNL machines via SDE.
    although it is possible to install hbwmalloc implementation on such
    systems, it is easier not to, since obviously the performance of SDE
    execution is not representative so there is no reason to emulate HBW
    allocation.

    Fixed a trsm1m bug that affected right-side cases.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug introduced in 1c732d3 that affected trsm1m_r. The result
      was nondeterministic behavior (usually segmentation faults) for certain
      problem sizes beyond the 1m instance of kc (e.g. 128 on haswell). The
      cause of the bug was my commenting out lines in bli_gemm1m_ukr_ref.c
      which explicitly directed the virtual gemm micro-kernel to use temporary
      space if the storage preference of the [real domain] gemm ukernel did
      not match the storage of the output matrix C. In the context of gemm,
      this handling is not needed because agreement between the storage pref
      and the matrix is guaranteed by a high-level optimization in BLIS.
      However, this optimization is not applied to trsm because the storage
      of C is not necessarily the same as the storage of the micro-panels of
      B--both of which are updated by the micro-kernel during a trsm
      operation. Thus, the guarantee of storage/preference agreement is not
      in place for trsm, which means we must handle that case within the
      virtual gemm micro-kernel.
    - Comment updates and a minor macro change to bli_trsm*_cntx_init() for
      3m1, 4m1a, and 1m.

    Added 1m-specific APIs for bp, pb gemm algorithms.
    
    Details:
    - Defined bli_gemmbp_cntl_create(), bli_gemmpb_cntl_create(), with the
      body of bli_gemm_cntl_create() replaced with a call to the former.
    - Defined bli_cntl_free_w_thrinfo(), bli_cntl_free_wo_thrinfo(). Now,
      bli_cntl_free() can check if the thread parameter is NULL, and if so,
      call the latter, and otherwise call the former.
    - Defined bli_gemm1mbp_cntx_init(), bli_gemm1mpb_cntx_init(), both in
      terms of bli_gemm1mxx_cntx_init(), which behaves the same as
      bli_gemm1m_cntx_init() did before, except that an extra bool parameter
      (is_pb) is used to support both bp and pb algorithms (including to
      support the anti-preference field described below).
    - Added support for "anti-preference" in context. The anti_pref field,
      when true, will toggle the boolean return value of routines such as
      bli_cntx_l3_ukr_eff_prefers_storage_of(), which has the net effect of
      causing BLIS to transpose the operation to achieve disagreement (rather
      than agreement) between the storage of C and the micro-kernel output
      preference. This disagreement is needed for panel-block implementations,
      since they induce a transposition of the suboperation immediately before
      the macro-kernel is called, which changes the apparent storage of C. For
      now, anti-preference is used only with the pb algorithm for 1m (and not
      with any other non-1m implementation).
    - Defined new functions,
        bli_cntx_l3_ukr_eff_prefers_storage_of()
        bli_cntx_l3_ukr_eff_dislikes_storage_of()
        bli_cntx_l3_nat_ukr_eff_prefers_storage_of()
        bli_cntx_l3_nat_ukr_eff_dislikes_storage_of()
      which are identical to their non-"eff" (effectively) counterparts except
      that they take the anti-preference field of the context into account.
    - Explicitly initialize the anti-pref field to FALSE in
      bli_gks_cntx_set_l3_nat_ukr_prefs().
    - Added bli_gemm_ker_var1.c, which implements a panel-block macro-kernel
      in terms of the existing block-panel macro-kernel _ker_var2(). This
      technique requires inducing transposes on all operands and swapping
      the A and B.
    - Changed bli_obj_induce_trans() macro so that pack-related fields are
      also changed to reflect the induced transposition.
    - Added a temporary hack to bli_l3_3m4m1m_oapi.c that allows us to easily
      specify the 1m algorithm (block-panel or panel-block).
    - Renamed the following cntx_t-related macros:
        bli_cntx_get_pack_schema_a() -> bli_cntx_get_pack_schema_a_block()
        bli_cntx_get_pack_schema_b() -> bli_cntx_get_pack_schema_b_panel()
        bli_cntx_get_pack_schema_c() -> bli_cntx_get_pack_schema_c_panel()
      and updated all instantiations. Also updated the field names in the
      cntx_t struct.
    - Comment updates.

    Implemented the 1m method.
    
    Details:
    - Implemented the 1m method for inducing complex domain matrix
      multiplication. 1m support has been added to all level-3 operations,
      including trsm, and is now the default induced method when native
      complex domain gemm microkernels are omitted from the configuration.
    - Updated _cntx_init() operations to take a datatype parameter. This was
      needed for the corresponding function for 1m (because 1m requires us
      to choose between column-oriented or row-oriented execution, which
      requires us to query the context for the storage preference of the
      gemm microkernel, which requires knowing the datatype) but I decided
      that it made sense for consistency to add the parameter to all other
      cntx initialization functions as well, even though those functions
      don't use the parameter.
    - Updated bli_cntx_set_blkszs() and bli_gks_cntx_set_blkszs() to take
      a second scalar for each blocksize entry. The semantic meaning of the
      two scalars now is that the first will scale the default blocksize
      while the second will scale the maximum blocksize. This allows scaling
      the two independently, and was needed to support 1m, which requires
      scaling for a register blocksize but not the register storage
      blocksize (ie: "packdim") analogue.
    - Deprecated bli_blksz_reduce_dt_to() and defined two new functions,
      bli_blksz_reduce_def_to() and bli_blksz_reduce_max_to(), for reducing
      default and maximum blocksizes to some desired blocksize multiple.
      These functions are needed in the updated definitions of
      bli_cntx_set_blkszs() and bli_gks_cntx_set_blkszs().
    - Added support for the 1e and 1r packing schemas to packm, including
      1e/1r packing kernels.
    - Added a minor optimization to bli_gemm_ker_var2() that allows, under
      certain circumstances (specifically, real domain beta and row- or
      column-stored matrix C), the real domain macrokernel and microkernel
      to be called directly, rather than using the virtual microkernel
      via the complex domain macrokernel, which carries a slight additional
      amount of overhead.
    - Added 1m support to the testsuite.
    - Added 1m support to Makefile and runme.sh in test/3m4m. Also simplified
      some code in test_gemm.c driver.

    never use libm with Intel compilers
    
    Intel compilers include a highly optimized math library (libimf) that
    should be used instead of GNU libm.
    
    yes, this change is for ALL targets, including those that are not
    supported by the Intel compiler.  there is no harm in doing this, and it
    is future-proof in the event that the Intel compilers support other
    architectures.

    Modified bli_getopt() for thread-safety.
    
    Details:
    - Changed the interface of bli_getopt() to take a new argument, a getopt_t
      struct, that stores the values of optarg, optind, opterr, and optopt,
      and updated the implementation accordingly. (Previously,  these
      variables were assumed to be global.)
    - Added a function for initializing a getopt_t struct.
    - Changed test_libblis.c--currently the only consumer of bli_getopt()--to
      utilize the new getopt_t state object.

    Create/install monolithic cblas.h.
    
    Details:
    - When CBLAS is enabled at configure-time, BLIS now creates a monolithic
      cblas.h using the same flatten-header.sh script that was recently
      introduced for creating monolithic blis.h header files. The top-level
      Makefile will also install this cblas.h file into the install prefix
      alongside blis.h when the 'install' target is invoked. The two header
      files are compatible with one another. Regardless whether the user's
      source #includes cblas.h, both blis.h and cblas.h, or just blis.h,
      the user will get the CBLAS function prototypes and enums, as expected.

    - Modified configure to create an 'include/<configname>' directory in which

    - Modified the top-level Makefile so that a monolithic header is generated
      unconditionally prior to compilation (stored in include/<configname>) and
      so that the single header is installed instead of the 450 or so header
      files that reside throughout the framework source tree.
    - Added "include/*/*.h" to .gitignore file.

    Details:
    - Added support for the x86_64 configuration family to bli_arch.c and
      bli_arch_config.h. Thanks to Johannes Dieterich for reporting this

    - Bumped the default value for BLIS_SIMD_NUM_REGISTERS from 16 to 32 and
      the default value for BLIS_SIMD_SIZE from 32 to 64. This will support
      configuration families that include Skylake and newer processors without
      any supported needed in the bli_family_*.h file. The semantics of these
      values have always been "maximum" and not exact values; comments in
      bli_kernel_macro_defs.h and the github wiki have been adjusted
      accordingly.

    Fixed a bug in e31f0b3/b131b9a.
    
    Details:
    - Erroneously placed the "don't overwrite existing blocksize" logic in
      bli_blksz_init*() rather than in bli_cntx_set_blkszs(). It belongs in
      the latter because that function copies blocksizes as-is from the
      blksz_t function argument to the appropriate field in the cntx_t. If
      the blksz_t was previously initialized selectively, based on the sign
      of the blocksize value passed into bli_blksz_init*(), that just leaves
      some fields possibly uninitialized (with garbage values), which
      definitely will not work.
    - The aforementioned logic has been moved to bli_cntx_set_blkszs() via
      a new function bli_blksz_copy_if_pos(), which selectively copies only
      the blocksizes that are greater than zero.

      register and cache blocksizes that correpond to gemm microkernel
      datatypes that were not registered, allowing the default values
      set by the bli_cntx_init_*_ref() function call to remain.

    - It appears that Travis CL has implemented a new policy that results in
      a test failing if it does not produce any output for more than 10
      minutes. (Two test instances are now failing in Travis despite the most
      recent commit not affecting the library or testsuite.) This issue can
      be worked around by executing the test run via travis_wait, which takes
      an optional time parameter. This commit attempts to use 'travis_wait 30'
      in the .travis.yml file to prevent the early failure at 10 minutes.

    After discussion with fgvanzee, a) it's "generic" and 2) use it for all the families as a fallback. Goal is that if a specific CPU is not yet supported by a family (say a new Intel microarchitecture on x86_64), it'll fall through to still work with the slower "generic" kernels

    Details:
    - Added a new script, monolithify-header.sh, to the 'build' directory.
      This script recursively replaces all #include directives in a selected
      file with the contents of the header files referenced by each directive.
      The idea is to "flatten" a tree of .h files into a single file, with
      the script acting as a C preprocessor that only processes #include
      directives.

    Details:
    - Removed an errant #include "blis.h directive from bli_cntx_ind_stage.h.
      The generaly policy is that no header file in BLIS should include
      blis.h. This will be important in the near future when using a tool to
      recursively create a monolithic blis.h file from its consitutent
      headers.

    Miscellaneous tweaks to gks, rt functionality.
    
    Details:
    - Updated bli_cpuid_query_id() so that BLIS_ARCH_GENERIC is always returned
      if the hardware fails to test positive for any supported sub-configuration.
    - Defined bli_gks_init_ref_cntx(), which will call the context initialization
      function bli_cntx_init_configname() for the sub-configuration 'configname'
      associated with the arch_t id returned by bli_arch_query_id(). This makes
      initializing a reference context easy for experts who wish to construct
      those contexts.

    Miscellaneous tweaks and fixes.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed incorrect calling sequence in bli_cntx_init_knl.c--an instance of
      bli_blksz_init_easy() that should have been bli_blksz_init().
    - Fixed a bug in code that is supposed to output the list of sub-directories
      in the 'config' directory when configure script is run with no arguments.
    - Expanded the output of "make showconfig" to include more info from config.mk.
    - Minor changes to build/auto-detect/cpuid_x86.c, mostly in preparation for
      someone to add excavator and zen support.
    - Added a link to the ConfigurationHowTo wiki to config_registry.
    - Other minor tweaks to configure.

    Implemented runtime hardware detection via cpuid.
    
    Details:
    - Added runtime support for selecting an appropriate arch_t value based
      on the results of the cpuid instruction (for x86_64). This allows
      deferral of choosing a context (kernels, blocksizes, etc.) until
      runtime, which allows BLIS to be built with support for multiple
      microarchitectures. Currently, only amd64 and intel64 configurations
      are registered in the config_registry; however, one could create
      custom configuration families to support arbitrary sets of x86_64
      microarchitectures.
    - Current Intel microarchitectures supported via cpuid are knl, haswell,
      sandybridge, and penryn.
    - Current AMD microarchitectures supported via cpuid are: zen, excavator,
      steamroller, piledriver, and bulldozer.

    Details:
    - Discovered that sed commands where the replacement string contains '\n'
      are problematic with the version of sed present in OS X. For these cases
      cases in the configure script, we instead use 'perl -pe' for
      search-and-replace functionality.
    - Various other minor comment/whitespace tweaks to configure.
    - Removed remaining lines of code related to setting/checking variables to
      track "unregistered" configurations.

      "bli_arch_config.h" and "bli_arch_config_pre.h", respectively.

      'make test' should now work as expected.

      BLIS source distribution before including common.mk in order to acquire
      all of the definitions typically needed in a Makefile that tests BLIS.

    Implemented runtime kernel management.
    
    Details:
    - Reworked the build system around a configuration registry file, named
      config_registry', that identifies valid configuration targets, their
      constituent sub-configurations, and the kernel sets that are needed by
      those sub-configurations. The build system now facilitates the building
      of a single library that can contains kernels and cache/register
      blocksizes for multiple configurations (microarchitectures). Reference
      kernels are also built on a per-configuration basis.
    - Updated the Makefile to use new variables set by configure via the
      config.mk.in template, such as CONFIG_LIST, KERNEL_LIST, and KCONFIG_MAP,
      in determining which sub-configurations (CONFIG_LIST) and kernel sets
      (KERNEL_LIST) are included in the library, and which make_defs.mk files'
      CFLAGS (KCONFIG_MAP) are used when compiling kernels.
    - Reorganized 'kernels' directory into a "flat" structure. Renamed kernel
      functions into a standard format that includes the kernel set name
      (e.g. 'haswell'). Created a "bli_kernels_<kernelset>.h" file in each
      kernels sub-directory. These files exist to provide prototypes for the
      kernels present in those directories.
    - Reorganized reference kernels into a top-level 'ref_kernels' directory.
      This directory includes a new source file, bli_cntx_ref.c (compiled on
      a per-configuration basis), that defines the code needed to initialize
      a reference context and a context for induced methods for the
      microarchitecture in question.
    - Rewrote make_defs.mk files in each configuration so that the compiler
      variables (e.g. CFLAGS) are "stored" (renamed) on a per-configuration
      basis.
    - Modified bli_config.h.in template so that bli_config.h is generated with
      #defines for the config (family) name, the sub-configurations that are
      associated with the family, and the kernel sets needed by those
      sub-configurations.
    - Deprecated all kernel-related information in bli_kernel.h and transferred
      what remains to new header files named "bli_arch_<configname>.h", which
      are conditionally #included from a new header bli_arch.h. These files
      are still needed to set library-wide parameters such as custom
      malloc()/free() functions or SIMD alignment values.
    - Added bli_cntx_init_<configname>.c files to each configuration directory.
      The files contain a function, named the same as the file, that initializes
      a "native" context for a particular configuration (microarchitecture). The
      idea is that optimized kernels, if available, will be initialized into
      these contexts. Other fields will retain pointers to reference functions,
      which will be compiled on a per-configuration basis. These bli_cntx_init_*()
      functions will be called during the initialization of the global kernel
      structure. They are thought of as initializing for "native" execution, but
      they also form the basis for contexts that use induced methods. These
      functions are prototyped, along with their _ref() and _ind() brethren, by
      prototype-generating macros in bli_arch.h.
    - Added a new typedef enum in bli_type_defs.h to define an arch_t, which
      identifies the various sub-configurations.
    - Redesigned the global kernel structure (gks) around a 2D array of cntx_t
      structures (pointers to cntx_t, actually). The first dimension is indexed
      over arch_t and the inner dimension is the ind_t (induced method) for
      each microarchitecture. When a microarchitecture (configuration) is
      "registered" at init-time, the inner array for that configuration in the
      2D array is initialized (and allocated, if it hasn't been already). The
      cntx_t slot for BLIS_NAT is initialized immediately and those for other
      induced method types are initialized and cached on-demand, as needed. At
      cntx_t registration, we also store function pointers to cntx_init functions
      that will initialize (a) "reference" contexts and (b) contexts for use with
      induced methods. We don't cache the full contexts for reference contexts
      since they are rarely needed. The functions that initialize these two kinds
      of contexts are generated automatically for each targeted sub-configuration
      from cpp-templatized code at compile-time. Induced method contexts that
      need "stage" adjustments can still obtain them via functions in
      bli_cntx_ind_stage.c.
    - Added new functions and functionality to bli_cntx.c, such as for setting
      the level-1f, level-1v, and packm kernels, and for converting a native
      context into one for executing an induced method.
    - Moved the checking of register/cache blocksize consistency from being cpp
      macros in bli_kernel_macro_defs.h to being runtime checks defined in
      bli_check.c and called from bli_gks_register_cntx() at the time that the
      global kernel structure's internal context is initialized for a given
      microarchitecture/configuration.
    - Deprecated all of the old per-operation bli_*_cntx.c files and removed
      the previous operation-level cntx_t_init()/_finalize() invocations.
      Instead, we now query the gks for a suitable context, usually via
      bli_gks_query_cntx().
    - Deprecated support for the 3m2 and 3m3 induced methods. (They required
      hackery that I was no longer willing to support.)
    - Consolidated the 1e and 1r packm kernels for any given register blocksize
      into a single kernel that will branch on the schema and support packing
      to both formats.
    - Added the cntx_t* argument to all packm kernel signatures.
    - Deprecated the local function pointer array in all bli_packm_cxk*.c files
      and instead obtain the packm kernel from the cntx_t.
    - Added bli_calloc_intl(), which serves as the calloc-equivalent to to
      bli_malloc_intl(). Useful when we wish to allocate and initialize to
      zero/NULL.
    - Converted existing cpp macro functions defined in bli_blksz.h, bli_func.h,
      bli_cntx.h into static functions.

    Thread Safety: Move bli_init() before and bli_finalize() after main()
    
    BLIS provides APIs to initialize and finalize its global context.
    One application thread can finalize BLIS, while other threads
    in the application are stil using BLIS.
    
    This issue can be solved by removing bli_finalize() from API.
    One way to do this is by getting bli_finalize() to execute by default
    after application exits from main().
    
    GCC supports this behaviour with the help of __attribute__((destructor))
    added to the function that need to be executed after main exits.
    
    Similarly bli_init() can be made to run before application enters main()
    so that application need not call it.

    Thread safety: Make the global induced method status array local to thread
    
    BLIS retains a global status array for induced methods, and provides
    APIs to modify this state during runtime. So, one application thread
    can modify the state, before another starts the corresponding
    BLIS operation.
    
    This patch solves this issue by making the induced method status array
    local to threads.

    Fixed bugs in gemm/gemmtrsm ukr tests in testsuite.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in gemmtrsm test module that was due to improper partitioning
      into a k x k triangular matrix for the purposes of obtaining an mr x k
      micropanel of A with which to test.
    - Fixed a bug in gemm and gemmtrsm test modules that would only manifest for
      very large k (depending on the product of mr x kc on that architecture).
      The bug arose from the fact that the test module was triggering the
      allocation of blocks from the internal memory pools, which are limited in
      size. This allocation imposes an implicit assumption that the micro-
      panel being tested with will fit inside, and this assumption is violated
      for large values of k. Arbitrarily large k may now be tested for both
      operation tests.
    - Added OpenMP/pthread critical sections around the setting or getting of
      statuses from the induced method operation lookup table in bli_l3_ind.c.
    - Added the 'static' keyword to all pthread_mutex_t global variables in BLIS.

    Added edge handling to _determine_blocksize_b().
    
    Details:
    - Added explicit handling of situations where i == dim to
      bli_determine_blocksize_b_sub(). This isn't actually needed by any
      current use case within BLIS, but handling the situation is nonetheless
      prudent. Thanks to Minh Quan for reporting this issue and requesting
      the fix.

    Fixed a minor bug in level-3 packm management.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in bli_l3_packm() that caused cntl_t-cached packed mem_t
      entries to be released and then re-acquired unnecessarily. (In essence,
      the "<" operands in the conditional that guards the
      release-and-reacquire code block simply needed to be swapped.) The bug
      should have only affected performance (rather than the computed result).
      Thanks to Minh Quan for identifying and reporting the bug.

    Moved 'family' field from cntx_t to cntl_t.
    
    Details:
    - Removed the family field inside the cntx_t struct and re-added it to the
      cntl_t struct. Updated all accessor functions/macros accordingly, as well
      as all consumers and intermediaries of the family parameter (such as
      bli_l3_thread_decorator(), bli_l3_direct(), and bli_l3_prune_*()). This
      change was motivated by the desire to keep the context limited, as much
      as possible, to information about the computing environment. (The family
      field, by contrast, is a descriptor about the operation being executed.)
    - Added additional functions to bli_blksz_*() API.
    - Added additional functions to bli_cntx_*() API.
    - Minor updates to bli_func.c, bli_mbool.c.
    - Removed 'obj' from bli_blksz_*() API names.
    - Removed 'obj' from bli_cntx_*() API names.
    - Removed 'obj' from bli_cntl_*(), bli_*_cntl_*() API names. Renamed routines
      that operate only on a single struct to contain the "_node" suffix to
      differentiate with those routines that operate on the entire tree.
    - Added enums for packm and unpackm kernels to bli_type_defs.h.
    - Removed BLIS_1F and BLIS_VF from bszid_t definition in bli_type_defs.h.
      They weren't being used and probably never will be.

    Updated ar option list used by all configurations.
    
    Details:
    - Dropped 'u' from the list of modifiers passed into the library archiver
      ar. Previously, "cru" was used, while now we employ only "cr". This
      change was prompted by a warning observed on Ubuntu 16.04:
    
        ar: `u' modifier ignored since `D' is the default (see `U')
    
      This caused me to realize that the default mode causes timestamps to be
      zero, and thus the 'u' option, which causes only changed object files to
      be inserted, is not applicable.

    Added --force-version=STRING option to configure.
    
    Details:
    - Added an option to configure that allows the user to force an arbitrary
      version string at configure-time. The help text also now describes the
      usage information.
    - Changed the way the version string is communicated to the Makefile.
      Previously, it was read into the VERSION variable from the 'version' file
      via $(shell cat ...). Now, the VERSION variable is instead set in
      config.mk (via a configure-substituted anchor from config.mk.in).

commit 13175c5fb70fb6a378d5fff6ecede62e5ea6a1f6
Author: Field G. Van Zee <field@cs.utexas.edu>
Date:   Tue Jul 18 17:56:00 2017 -0500

    Updated openmp/pthread barriers with GNU atomics.
    
    Details:
    - Updated the non-tree openmp and pthreads barriers defined in
      bli_thrcomm_openmp.c and bli_thrcomm_pthreads.c to instead call a common
      implementation in bli_thrcomm.c, bli_thrcomm_barrier_atomic(). This new
      implementation goes through the same motions as the previous codes, but
      protects its loads and increments with GNU atomic built-ins. These atomic
      statements take memory ordering parameters that allow us to specify just
      enough constraints for the barrier to work as intended on weakly-ordered
      hardware. The prior implementation was only guaranteed to work on systems
      with strongly- ordered memory. (Thanks to Devin Matthews for suggesting
      this change and his crash-course in atomics and memory ordering.)
    - Removed 'volatile' from structs' barrier field declarations in
      bli_thrcomm_*.h.
    - Updated bli_thrcomm_pthread.? files to use renamed struct barrier fields
      consistent with that of the _openmp.? files.
    - Updated other bli_thrcomm_* files to rename "communicator" variables to
      simply "comm".

    Added API to set mt environment variables.
    
    Details:
    - Renamed bli_env_get_nway() -> bli_thread_get_env().
    - Added bli_thread_set_env() to allow setting environment variables
      pertaining to multithreading, such as BLIS_JC_NT or BLIS_NUM_THREADS.
    - Added the following convenience wrapper routines:
        bli_thread_get_jc_nt()
        bli_thread_get_ic_nt()
        bli_thread_get_jr_nt()
        bli_thread_get_ir_nt()

        bli_thread_set_jr_nt()
        bli_thread_set_ir_nt()
        bli_thread_set_num_threads()
    - Added #include "errno.h" to bli_system.h.
    - This commit addresses issue #140.
    - Thanks to Chris Goodyer for inspiring these updates.

    Improved efficiency of dGEMM for large matrices by reducing TLB load misses and majorly L3 cache misses. This is achieved by changing the packed block sizes of matrix A & B. Now the optimum values are MC_D = 510 and KC_D = 1024.

    Housekeeping, induced method file/function renames.
    
    Details:
    - Renamed all level-3 induced method files to use the "_vir.c" suffix
      instead of "_ref.c". Also renamed functions within these files
      accordingly.
    - Renamed cpp macro definitions in frame/ind/include according to the
      above changes.
    - Removed frame/3/old.

commit cf39d3ef3b29b8058c39fb4638c1a734fe64aaed

    Fixed a bug in norm1v, norm1m.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug that manifested as improperly-computed 1-norm for vectors
      and matrices. This is one of the few operations in BLIS that does not
      have its own test module within the testsuite, hence why it went
      undetected for so long. The bad 1-norms were being used to normalize
      matrices in the testsuite after initialization, which led to some
      matrices containing a combination of "large" and "small" values. This
      tended to push the residuals computed after each test away from zero.
      In some cases, they were off *just* enough to the testsuite to label
      it a "failure". Many thanks to Jeff Hammond for reporting this bug.
      (Wonky details: the bug was due to improperly-defined level-0 scalar
      macros for abval2, an operation that computes the absolute square,
      or complex magnitude/modulus. Certain complex domain instances of
      abval2 were being incorrectly defined in terms of real-only solutions,
      leading to bad results. This level-0 operation forms the basis of
      norm1v/norm1m. absq2 was also affected, but almost nothing uses
      this operation.)

    allow KNL build without hbwmalloc.h (i.e. emulated)
    
    we want to be able to run BLIS KNL binaries on non-KNL machines via SDE.
    although it is possible to install hbwmalloc implementation on such
    systems, it is easier not to, since obviously the performance of SDE
    execution is not representative so there is no reason to emulate HBW
    allocation.

    Fixed a trsm1m bug that affected right-side cases.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug introduced in 1c732d3 that affected trsm1m_r. The result
      was nondeterministic behavior (usually segmentation faults) for certain
      problem sizes beyond the 1m instance of kc (e.g. 128 on haswell). The
      cause of the bug was my commenting out lines in bli_gemm1m_ukr_ref.c
      which explicitly directed the virtual gemm micro-kernel to use temporary
      space if the storage preference of the [real domain] gemm ukernel did
      not match the storage of the output matrix C. In the context of gemm,
      this handling is not needed because agreement between the storage pref
      and the matrix is guaranteed by a high-level optimization in BLIS.
      However, this optimization is not applied to trsm because the storage
      of C is not necessarily the same as the storage of the micro-panels of
      B--both of which are updated by the micro-kernel during a trsm
      operation. Thus, the guarantee of storage/preference agreement is not
      in place for trsm, which means we must handle that case within the
      virtual gemm micro-kernel.
    - Comment updates and a minor macro change to bli_trsm*_cntx_init() for
      3m1, 4m1a, and 1m.

    Added 1m-specific APIs for bp, pb gemm algorithms.
    
    Details:
    - Defined bli_gemmbp_cntl_create(), bli_gemmpb_cntl_create(), with the
      body of bli_gemm_cntl_create() replaced with a call to the former.
    - Defined bli_cntl_free_w_thrinfo(), bli_cntl_free_wo_thrinfo(). Now,
      bli_cntl_free() can check if the thread parameter is NULL, and if so,
      call the latter, and otherwise call the former.
    - Defined bli_gemm1mbp_cntx_init(), bli_gemm1mpb_cntx_init(), both in
      terms of bli_gemm1mxx_cntx_init(), which behaves the same as
      bli_gemm1m_cntx_init() did before, except that an extra bool parameter
      (is_pb) is used to support both bp and pb algorithms (including to
      support the anti-preference field described below).
    - Added support for "anti-preference" in context. The anti_pref field,
      when true, will toggle the boolean return value of routines such as
      bli_cntx_l3_ukr_eff_prefers_storage_of(), which has the net effect of
      causing BLIS to transpose the operation to achieve disagreement (rather
      than agreement) between the storage of C and the micro-kernel output
      preference. This disagreement is needed for panel-block implementations,
      since they induce a transposition of the suboperation immediately before
      the macro-kernel is called, which changes the apparent storage of C. For
      now, anti-preference is used only with the pb algorithm for 1m (and not
      with any other non-1m implementation).
    - Defined new functions,
        bli_cntx_l3_ukr_eff_prefers_storage_of()
        bli_cntx_l3_ukr_eff_dislikes_storage_of()
        bli_cntx_l3_nat_ukr_eff_prefers_storage_of()
        bli_cntx_l3_nat_ukr_eff_dislikes_storage_of()
      which are identical to their non-"eff" (effectively) counterparts except
      that they take the anti-preference field of the context into account.
    - Explicitly initialize the anti-pref field to FALSE in
      bli_gks_cntx_set_l3_nat_ukr_prefs().
    - Added bli_gemm_ker_var1.c, which implements a panel-block macro-kernel
      in terms of the existing block-panel macro-kernel _ker_var2(). This
      technique requires inducing transposes on all operands and swapping
      the A and B.
    - Changed bli_obj_induce_trans() macro so that pack-related fields are
      also changed to reflect the induced transposition.
    - Added a temporary hack to bli_l3_3m4m1m_oapi.c that allows us to easily
      specify the 1m algorithm (block-panel or panel-block).
    - Renamed the following cntx_t-related macros:
        bli_cntx_get_pack_schema_a() -> bli_cntx_get_pack_schema_a_block()
        bli_cntx_get_pack_schema_b() -> bli_cntx_get_pack_schema_b_panel()
        bli_cntx_get_pack_schema_c() -> bli_cntx_get_pack_schema_c_panel()
      and updated all instantiations. Also updated the field names in the
      cntx_t struct.
    - Comment updates.

    Implemented the 1m method.
    
    Details:
    - Implemented the 1m method for inducing complex domain matrix
      multiplication. 1m support has been added to all level-3 operations,
      including trsm, and is now the default induced method when native
      complex domain gemm microkernels are omitted from the configuration.
    - Updated _cntx_init() operations to take a datatype parameter. This was
      needed for the corresponding function for 1m (because 1m requires us
      to choose between column-oriented or row-oriented execution, which
      requires us to query the context for the storage preference of the
      gemm microkernel, which requires knowing the datatype) but I decided
      that it made sense for consistency to add the parameter to all other
      cntx initialization functions as well, even though those functions
      don't use the parameter.
    - Updated bli_cntx_set_blkszs() and bli_gks_cntx_set_blkszs() to take
      a second scalar for each blocksize entry. The semantic meaning of the
      two scalars now is that the first will scale the default blocksize
      while the second will scale the maximum blocksize. This allows scaling
      the two independently, and was needed to support 1m, which requires
      scaling for a register blocksize but not the register storage
      blocksize (ie: "packdim") analogue.
    - Deprecated bli_blksz_reduce_dt_to() and defined two new functions,
      bli_blksz_reduce_def_to() and bli_blksz_reduce_max_to(), for reducing
      default and maximum blocksizes to some desired blocksize multiple.
      These functions are needed in the updated definitions of
      bli_cntx_set_blkszs() and bli_gks_cntx_set_blkszs().
    - Added support for the 1e and 1r packing schemas to packm, including
      1e/1r packing kernels.
    - Added a minor optimization to bli_gemm_ker_var2() that allows, under
      certain circumstances (specifically, real domain beta and row- or
      column-stored matrix C), the real domain macrokernel and microkernel
      to be called directly, rather than using the virtual microkernel
      via the complex domain macrokernel, which carries a slight additional
      amount of overhead.
    - Added 1m support to the testsuite.
    - Added 1m support to Makefile and runme.sh in test/3m4m. Also simplified
      some code in test_gemm.c driver.

Author: Field G. Van Zee <field@cs.utexas.edu>
Date:   Wed Nov 23 17:59:06 2016 -0600

    Switched to simpler trsm_r implementation.
    
    Details:
    - Disabled the implementation of trsm_r that allows the right-hand matrix
      B to be trianglar, and switched to the implementation that simply
      transposes the operation (and thus the storage of C) in order to recast
      the operation as trsm_l. This avoids the need to use trsm_rl and trsm_ru
      macrokernels, which require an awkward swapping of MR and NR. For now,
      the support for trsm_r macrokernels, via separate control trees, remains.
    - Modified bli_config_macro_defs.h so that BLIS_RELAX_MCNR_NCMR_CONSTRAINTS
      is defined by default. This is mostly a safety precaution in case someone
      tries to switch back to the previous trsm_r implementation, but also
      serves as a convenience on some systems where one does not naturally
      choose blocksizes in a way that satisfies MC % NR = 0 and NC % MR = 0.

    Adjusted stride selection of ct in macrokernels.
    
    Details:
    - Updated the changes introduced in 618f433 so that the strides of the
      temporary microtile ct used in the macrokernels is determined based
      on the storage preference of the microkernel (via the new functions
      below), rather than the strides of c. In almost all cases, presently,
      this change results in no net effect, as a high-level optimization
      in the _front() functions aligns the storage of c to that of the
      microkernel's preference. However, I encountered some cases where
      this is not always the case in some development code that has yet
      to be committed, and therefore I'm generalizing the framework code
      in advance.
    - Defined two new functions in bli_cntx.c:
        bli_cntx_l3_ukr_prefers_rows_dt()
        bli_cntx_l3_ukr_prefers_cols_dt()
      which return bool_t's based on the current micro-kernel's storage
      preferences. For induced methods, the preference of the underlying
      real domain microkernel is returned.
    - Updated definition of bli_cntx_l3_ukr_dislikes_storage_of(), and
      by proxy bli_cntx_l3_ukr_prefers_storage_of(), to be in terms of
      the above functions, rather than querying the preferences of the
      native microkernel directly (which did the wrong thing for induced
      methods).

    Details:
    - Changed a cpp macro that was meant to prevent using certain trsm_r code
      if BLIS_RELAX_MCNR_NCMR_CONSTRAINTS was defined. It was actually coded
      incorrectly at first. I've now fixed its location and changed its
      consequence to a compile-time #error message.

    Can disable trsm_r-specific blocksize constraints.
    
    Details:
    - Added cpp guards around the constraints in bli_kernel_macro_defs.h
      that enforce MC % NR = 0 and NC % MR = 0. These constraints are ONLY
      needed when handling right-side trsm by allowing the matrix on the
      right (matrix B) to be triangular, because it involves swapping
      register, but not cache, blocksizes (packing A by NR and B by MR)
      and then swapping the operands to gemmtrsm just before that kernel
      is called. It may be useful to disable these constraints if, for
      example, the developer wishes to test the configuration with
      a different set of cache blocksizes where only MC % MR = 0 and
      NC % NR = 0 are enforced.
    - In summary, #defining BLIS_RELAX_MCNR_NCMR_CONSTRAINTS will bypass
      the enforcement of MC % NR = 0 and NC % MR = 0.

    Details:
    - Updated s and d microkernels in bli_gemm_asm_d8x6.c to relax alignment
      constraints.
    - Added missing c and z microkernels, which are based on the corresponding
      kernels in the d6x8 set.
    - This completes the d8x6 set (which may be used for situations when it
      is desirable to have a microkernel with a column preference).

    Align strides of ct in macrokernels to that of c.
    
    Details:
    - Previously, rs_ct and cs_ct, the strides of the temporary microtile used
      primarily in the macrokernels' edge case handling, were unconditionally
      set to 1 and MR, respectively. However, Devin Matthews noted that this
      ought to be changed so that the strides of ct were in agreement with the
      strides of C. (That is, if C was row-stored, then ct should be accessed
      as by rows as well.) The implicit assumption is that the strides of C
      have already been adjusted, via induced transposition, if the storage
      preference of the microkernel is at odds with the storage of C. So, if
      the microkernel prefers row storage, the macrokernel's interior cases
      would present row-stored (ideal) microkernel subproblems to the

    never use libm with Intel compilers
    
    Intel compilers include a highly optimized math library (libimf) that
    should be used instead of GNU libm.
    
    yes, this change is for ALL targets, including those that are not
    supported by the Intel compiler.  there is no harm in doing this, and it
    is future-proof in the event that the Intel compilers support other
    architectures.

    Removed auto-prototyping of malloc()/free() substitutes.
    
    Details:
    - Removed the header file, bli_malloc_prototypes.h, which automatically
      generated prototypes for the functions specified by the following
      cpp macros:
        BLIS_MALLOC_INTL
        BLIS_FREE_INTL
        BLIS_MALLOC_POOL
        BLIS_FREE_POOL
        BLIS_MALLOC_USER
        BLIS_FREE_USER
      These prototypes were originally provided primarily as a convenience
      to those developers who specified their own malloc()/free() substitutes
      for one or more of the following. However, we generated these prototypes
      regardless, even when the default values (malloc and free) of the
      macros above were used. A problem arose under certain circumstances
      (e.g., gcc in C++ mode on Linux with glibc) when including blis.h that
      stemmed from the "throw" specification which was added to the glibc's
      malloc() prototype, resulting in a prototype mismatch. Therefore, going
      forward, developers who specify their own custom malloc()/free()
      substitutes must also prototype those substitutes via bli_kernel.h.
      Thanks to Krzysztof Drewniak for reporting this bug, and Devin Matthews
      for researching the nature and potential solutions.

    - The redundant typedefs of membrk_t and mtx_t caused a warning on some C
      compilers. Thanks to Tyler Smith for reporting this issue.

      information and communicators are used in BLIS.

      mentioned above.

    Fixed bli_gemm() segfault on empty C matrices.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug that would manifest in the form of a segmentation fault
      in bli_cntl_free() when calling any level-3 operation on an empty
      output matrix (ie: m = n = 0). Specifically, the code previously
      assumed that the entire control tree was built prior to it being
      freed. However, if the level-3 operation performs an early exit, the
      control tree will be incomplete, and this scenario is now handled.

    Reclassified amaxv operation as a level-1v kernel.
    
    Details:
    - Moved amaxv from being a utility operation to being a level-1v operation.
      This includes the establishment of a new amaxv kernel to live beside all
      of the other level-1v kernels.
    - Added two new functions to bli_part.c:
        bli_acquire_mij()
        bli_acquire_vi()
      The first acquires a scalar object for the (i,j) element of a matrix,
      and the second acquires a scalar object for the ith element of a vector.
    - Added integer support to bli_getsc level-0 operation. This involved
      adding integer support to the bli_*gets level-0 scalar macros.
    - Added a new test module to test amaxv as a level-1v operation. The test
      module works by comparing the value identified by bli_amaxv() to the
      the value found from a reference-like code local to the test module
      source file. In other words, it (intentionally) does not guarantee the
      same index is found; only the same value. This allows for different
      implementations in the case where a vector contains two or more elements
      containing exactly the same floating point value (or values, in the case
      of the complex domain).
    - Removed the directory frame/include/old/.

    Implemented distributed thrinfo_t management.
    
    Details:
    - Implemented Ricardo Magana's distributed thread info/communicator
      management. Rather that fully construct the thrinfo_t structures, from
      root to leaf, prior to spawning threads, the threads individually
      construct their thrinfo_t trees (or, chains), and do so incrementally,
      as needed, reusing the same structure nodes during subsequent blocked
      variant iterations. This required moving the initial creation of the
      thrinfo_t structure (now, the root nodes) from the _front() functions
      to the bli_l3_thread_decorator(). The incremental "growing" of the tree
      is performed in the internal back-end (ie: _int()) function, and so
      mostly invisible. Also, the incremental growth of the thrinfo_t tree is
      done as a function of the current and parent control tree nodes (as well
      as the parent thrinfo_t node), further reinforcing the parallel
      relationship between the two data structures.
    - Removed the "inner" communicator from thrinfo_t structure definition,
      as well as its id. Changed all APIs accordingly. Renamed
      bli_thrinfo_needs_free_comms() to bli_thrinfo_needs_free_comm().
    - Defined bli_l3_thrinfo_print_paths(), which prints the information
      in an array of thrinfo_t* structure pointers. (Used only as a
      debugging/verification tool.)
    - Deprecated the following thrinfo_t creation functions:
        bli_packm_thrinfo_create()
        bli_l3_thrinfo_create()
      because they are no longer used. bli_thrinfo_create() is now called
      directly when creating thrinfo_t nodes.

      'openmp'. The previous expected string, 'omp', is still supported but
      should be considered deprecated.

    Avoid compiling BLAS/CBLAS files when disabled.
    
    Details:
    - Updated the top-level Makefile, build/config.mk.in template, and
      configure script so that object files corresponding to source files
      belonging to the BLAS compatibility layer are not compiled (or archived)
      when the compatibility layer is disabled. (Same for CBLAS.) Thanks
      to Devin Matthews for suggesting this optimization.
    - Slight change to the way configure handles internal variables. Instead
      of converting (overwriting) some, such as enable_blas2blis and
      enable_cblas, from a "yes" or "no" to a "1" or "0" value, the latter are
      now stored in new variables that live alongside the originals (with the
      suffix "_01").  This is convenient since some values need to be
      sed-substituted into the config.mk.in template, which requires "yes" or
      "no", while some need to be written to the bli_config.h.in template,
      which requires "0" or "1".
    
    Updated BLIS4 TOMS citation in README.md.
    
    Added complex gemm micro-kernels for haswell.
    
    Details:
    - Defined cgemm (3x8) and zgemm (3x4) micro-kernels for haswell-based
      architectures. As with their real domain brethren, these kernels perfer
      row storage, (though this doesn't affect most users due to high-level
      optimizations in most level-3 operations that induce a transpose to
      whatever storage preference the kernel may have).

    Added complex gemm micro-kernels for haswell.
    
    Details:
    - Defined cgemm (3x8) and zgemm (3x4) micro-kernels for haswell-based
      architectures. As with their real domain brethren, these kernels perfer
      row storage, (though this doesn't affect most users due to high-level
      optimizations in most level-3 operations that induce a transpose to
      whatever storage preference the kernel may have).

    Details:
    - Removed thread barriers from the end of the loop bodies of
      bli_gemm_blk_var1(), bli_gemm_blk_var2(), bli_trsm_blk_var1(),
      and bli_trsm_blk_var2().
    - Moved the thread barrier at the end of bli_packm_int() to the
      end of bli_l3_packm(), and added missing barriers to that function.
    - Removed the no longer necessary (and now incorrect) ochief guard
      in bli_gemm3m3_packa() on the bli_obj_scalar_reset() on C.
    - Thanks to Tyler Smith for help with these changes.

commit 701b9aa3ff028decbf90efac0dca5bd64fe26269
Author: Field G. Van Zee <field@cs.utexas.edu>
Date:   Fri Aug 26 19:04:45 2016 -0500

    Redesigned control tree infrastructure.
    
    Details:
    - Altered control tree node struct definitions so that all nodes have the
      same struct definition, whose primary fields consist of a blocksize id,
      a variant function pointer, a pointer to an optional parameter struct,
      and a pointer to a (single) sub-node. This unified control tree type is
      now named cntl_t.
    - Changed the way control tree nodes are connected, and what computation
      they represent, such that, for example, packing operations are now
      associated with nodes that are "inline" in the tree, rather than off-
      shoot braches. The original tree for the classic Goto gemm algorithm was
      expressed (roughly) as:
    
        blk_var2 -> blk_var3 -> blk_var1 -> ker_var2
                             |           |
                             -> packb    -> packa
    
      and now, the same tree would look like:
    
        blk_var2 -> blk_var3 -> packb -> blk_var1 -> packa -> ker_var2
    
      Specifically, the packb and packa nodes perform their respective packing
      operations and then recurse (without any loop) to a subproblem. This means
      there are now two kinds of level-3 control tree nodes: partitioning and
      non-partitioning. The blocked variants are members of the former, because
      they iteratively partition off submatrices and perform suboperations on
      those partitions, while the packing variants belong to the latter group.
      (This change has the effect of allowing greatly simplified initialization
      of the nodes, which previously involved setting many unused node fields to
      NULL.)
    - Changed the way thrinfo_t tree nodes are arranged to mirror the new
      connective structure of control trees. That is, packm nodes are no longer
      off-shoot branches of the main algorithmic nodes, but rather connected
      "inline".
    - Simplified control tree creation functions. Partitioning nodes are created
      concisely with just a few fields needing initialization. By contrast, the
      packing nodes require additional parameters, which are stored in a
      packm-specific struct that is tracked via the optional parameters pointer
      within the control tree struct. (This parameter struct must always begin
      with a uint64_t that contains the byte size of the struct. This allows
      us to use a generic function to recursively copy control trees.) gemm,
      herk, and trmm control tree creation continues to be consolidated into
      a single function, with the operation family being used to select
      among the parameter-agnostic macro-kernel wrappers. A single routine,
      bli_cntl_free(), is provided to free control trees recursively, whereby
      the chief thread within a groups release the blocks associated with
      mem_t entries back to the memory broker from which they were acquired.
    - Updated internal back-ends, e.g. bli_gemm_int(), to query and call the
      function pointer stored in the current control tree node (rather than
      index into a local function pointer array). Before being invoked, these
      function pointers are first cast to a gemm_voft (for gemm, herk, or trmm
      families) or trsm_voft (for trsm family) type, which is defined in
      frame/3/bli_l3_var_oft.h.
    - Retired herk and trmm internal back-ends, since all execution now flows
      through gemm or trsm blocked variants.
    - Merged forwards- and backwards-moving variants by querying the direction
      from routines as a function of the variant's matrix operands. gemm and
      herk always move forward, while trmm and trsm move in a direction that
      is dependent on which operand (a or b) is triangular.
    - Added functions bli_thread_get_range_mdim(), bli_thread_get_range_ndim(),
      each of which takes additional arguments and hides complexity in managing
      the difference between the way ranges are computed for the four families
      of operations.
    - Simplified level-3 blocked variants according to the above changes, so that
      the only steps taken are:
      1. Query partitioning direction (forwards or backwards).
      2. Prune unreferenced regions, if they exist.
      3. Determine the thread partitioning sub-ranges.
      <begin loop>
        4. Determine the partitioning blocksize (passing in the partitioning
           direction)
        5. Acquire the curren iteration's partitions for the matrices affected
           by the current variants's partitioning dimension (m, k, n).
        6. Call the subproblem.
      <end loop>
    - Instantiate control trees once per thread, per operation invocation.
      (This is a change from the previous regime in which control trees were
      treated as stateless objects, initialized with the library, and shared
      as read-only objects between threads.) This once-per-thread allocation
      is done primarily to allow threads to use the control tree as as place
      to cache certain data for use in subsequent loop iterations. Presently,
      the only application of this caching is a mem_t entry for the packing
      blocks checked out from the memory broker (allocator). If a non-NULL
      control tree is passed in by the (expert) user, then the tree is copied
      by each thread. This is done in bli_l3_thread_decorator(), in
      bli_thrcomm_*.c.
    - Added a new field to the context, and opid_t which tracks the "family"
      of the operation being executed. For example, gemm, hemm, and symm are
      all part of the gemm family, while herk, syrk, her2k, and syr2k are
      all part of the herk family. Knowing the operation's family is necessary
      when conditionally executing the internal (beta) scalar reset on on
      C in blocked variant 3, which is needed for gemm and herk families,
      but must not be performed for the trmm family (because beta has only
      been applied to the current row-panel of C after the first rank-kc
      iteration).
    - Reexpressed 3m3 induced method blocked variant in frame/3/gemm/ind
      to comform with the new control tree design, and renamed the macro-
      kernel codes corresponding to 3m2 and 4m1b.
    - Renamed bli_mem.c (and its APIs) to bli_memsys.c, and renamed/relocated
      bli_mem_macro_defs.h from frame/include to frame/base/bli_mem.h.
    - Renamed/relocated bli_auxinfo_macro_defs.h from frame/include to
      frame/base/bli_auxinfo.h.
    - Fixed a minor bug whereby the storage-to-ukr-preference matching
      optimization in the various level-3 front-ends was not being applied
      properly when the context indicated that execution would be via an
      induced method. (Before, we always checked the native micro-kernel
      corresponding to the datatype being executed, whereas now we check
      the native micro-kernel corresponding to the datatype's real projection,
      since that is the micro-kernel that is actually used by induced methods.
    - Added an option to the testsuite to skip the testing of native level-3
      complex implementations. Previously, it was always tested, provided that
      the c/z datatypes were enabled. However, some configurations use
      reference micro-kernels for complex datatypes, and testing these
      implementations can slow down the testsuite considerably.

    Avoid compiling BLAS/CBLAS files when disabled.
    
    Details:
    - Updated the top-level Makefile, build/config.mk.in template, and
      configure script so that object files corresponding to source files
      belonging to the BLAS compatibility layer are not compiled (or archived)
      when the compatibility layer is disabled. (Same for CBLAS.) Thanks
      to Devin Matthews for suggesting this optimization.
    - Slight change to the way configure handles internal variables. Instead
      of converting (overwriting) some, such as enable_blas2blis and
      enable_cblas, from a "yes" or "no" to a "1" or "0" value, the latter are
      now stored in new variables that live alongside the originals (with the
      suffix "_01").  This is convenient since some values need to be
      sed-substituted into the config.mk.in template, which requires "yes" or
      "no", while some need to be written to the bli_config.h.in template,
      which requires "0" or "1".

    Relax alignment restrictions for sandybridge ukrs.
    
    Details:
    - Relaxed the base pointer and leading dimension alignment restrictions
      in the sandybridge gemm microkernels, allowing the use of vmovups/vmovupd
      instead of vmovaps/vmovapd. These change mimic those made to the haswell
      microkernels in e0d2fa0 and ee2c139.
    - Updated testsuite modules as well as standalone test drivers in 'test'
      directory to use DBL_MAX as the initial time candidate. Thanks to Devin
      Matthews for suggesting this change.
    - Inserted #include "float.h" into bli_system.h (to gain access to DBL_MAX).
    - Minor update (vis-a-vis contexts) to driver code in test/3m4m.

    Integrated "memory broker" (membrk_t) abstraction.
    
    Details:
    - Integrated a patch originally authored and submitted by Ricardo Magana
      of HP Enterprise. The changeset inserts use of a new object type, membrk_t,
      (memory broker) that allows multiple sets of memory pools on, for example,
      separate NUMA nodes, each of which has a separate memory space.
    - Added membrk field to cntx_t and defined corresponding accessor macros.
    - Added membrk field to mem_t object and defined corresponding accessor macros.
    - Created new bli_membrk.c file, which contains the new memory broker API,
      including:
        bli_membrk_init(), bli_membrk_finalize()
        bli_membrk_acquire_[mv](), bli_membrk_release(),
        bli_membrk_init_pools(), bli_membrk_reinit_pools(),
        bli_membrk_finalize_pools(),
        bli_membrk_pool_size()
    - In bli_mem.c, changed function calls to
        bli_mem_init_pools()     -> bli_membrk_init()
        bli_mem_reinit_pools()   -> bli_membrk_reinit()
        bli_mem_finalize_pools() -> bli_membrk_finalize()
    - In bli_packv_init.c, bli_packm_init.c, changed function calls to:
        bli_mem_acquire_[mv]() -> bli_membrk_acquire_[mv]()
        bli_mem_release()      -> bli_membrk_release()
    - Added bli_mutex.c and related files to frame/thread. These files define
      abstract mutexes (locks) and corresponding APIs for pthreads, openmp, or
      single-threaded execution. This new API is employed within functions
      such as bli_membrk_acquire_[mv]() and bli_membrk_release().

    First phase of control tree redesign.
    
    Details:
    - These changes constitute the first set of changes in preparation to
      revamping the structure and use of control trees in BLIS. Modifications
      in this commit don't affect the control tree code yet, but rather lay
      the groundwork.
    - Defined wrappers for the following functions, where the the wrappers
      each take a direction parameter of a new enumerated type (BLIS_BWD or
      BLIS_FWD), dir_t, and executes the correct underlying function.
      - bli_acquire_mpart_*() and _vpart_*()
      - bli_*_determine_kc_[fb]()
      - bli_thread_get_range_*() and bli_thread_get_range_weighted_*()
    - Consolidated all 'f' (forwards-moving) and 'b' (backwards-moving)
      blocked variants for trmm and trsm, and renamed gemm and herk variants
      accordingly. The direction is now queried via routines such as
      bli_trmm_direct(), which deterines the direction from the implied side
      and uplo parameters. For gemm and herk, it is uncondtionally BLIS_FWD.
    - Defined wrappers to parameter-specific macrokernels for herk, trmm, and
      trsm, e.g. bli_trmm_xx_ker_var2(), that execute the correct underlying
      macrokernel based on the implied parameters. The same logic used to
      choose the dir_t in _direct() functions is used here.
    - Simplified the function pointer arrays in _int() functions given the
      consolidation and dir_t querying mentioned above.
    - Function signature (whitespace) reformatting for various functions.
    - Removed old code in various 'old' directories.

    Fixed compiler warning in rand[vm], randn[vm].
    
    Details:
    - Fixed compiler warnings about unused variables related to the disabling
      of normalization in the structured cases of the rand[vm] and randn[vm]
      operations.

commit a89555d1605574f3685813dcc972b636dd61264d
Author: Field G. Van Zee <field@cs.utexas.edu>
Date:   Fri Jun 17 14:08:35 2016 -0500

    Added randn[vm] operations, support in testsuite.
    
    Details:
    - Defined a new randomization operation, randn, on vectors and matrices.
      The randnv and randnm operations randomize each element of the target
      object with values from a narrow range of values. Presently, those
      values are all integer powers of two, but they do not need to be powers
      of two in order to achieve the primary goal, which is to initialize
      objects that can be operated on with plenty of precision "slack"
      available to allow computations that avoid roundoff. Using this method
      of randomization makes it much more likely that testsuite residuals of
      properly-functioning operations are close to zero, if not exactly zero.
    - Updated existing randomization operations randv and randm to skip
      special diagonal handling and normalization for matrices with structure.
      This is now handled by the testsuite modules by explicitly calling a
      testsuite function that loads the diagonal (and scales off-diagonal
      elements).
    - Added support for randnv and randnm in the testsuite with a new switch
      in input.general that universally toggles between use of the classic
      randv/randm, which use real values on the interval [-1,1], and
      randnv/randnm, which use only values from a narrow range. Currently,
      the narrow range is: +/-{2^0, 2^-1, 2^-2, 2^-3, 2^-4, 2^-5, 2^-6}, as
      well as 0.0.
    - Updated testsuite modules so that a testsutie wrapper function is called
      instead of directly calling the randomization operations (such as
      bli_randv() and bli_randm()). This wrapper also takes a bool_t that
      indicates whether the object's elements should be normalized. (NOTE: As
      alluded to above, in the test modules of triangular solve operations such
      as trsv and trsm, we perform the extra step of loading the diagonal.)
    - Defined a new level-0 operation, invertsc, which inverts a scalar.
    - Updated the abval2ris and sqrt2ris level-0 macros to avoid an unlikely
      but possible divide-by-zero.
    - Updated function signature and prototype formatting in testsuite.

    Reorganized code, APIs related to multithreading.
    
    Details:
    - Reorganized code and renamed files defining APIs related to multithreading.
      All code that is not specific to a particular operation is now located in a
      new directory: frame/thread. Code is now organized, roughly, by the
      namespace to which it belongs (see below).
    - Consolidated all operation-specific *_thrinfo_t object types into a single
      thrinfo_t object type. Operation-specific level-3 *_thrinfo_t APIs were
      also consolidated, leaving bli_l3_thrinfo_*() and bli_packm_thrinfo_*()
      functions (aside from a few general purpose bli_thrinfo_*() functions).
    - Renamed thread_comm_t object type to thrcomm_t.
    - Renamed many of the routines and functions (and macros) for multithreading.
      We now have the following API namespaces:
      - bli_thrinfo_*(): functions related to thrinfo_t objects
      - bli_thrcomm_*(): functions related to thrcomm_t objects.
      - bli_thread_*(): general-purpose functions, such as initialization,
        finalization, and computing ranges. (For now, some macros, such as
        bli_thread_[io]broadcast() and bli_thread_[io]barrier() use the
        bli_thread_ namespace prefix, even though bli_thrinfo_ may be more
        appropriate.)
    - Renamed thread-related macros so that they use a bli_ prefix.
    - Renamed control tree-related macros so that they use a bli_ prefix (to be
      consistent with the thread-related macros that were also renamed).
    - Removed #undef BLIS_SIMD_ALIGN_SIZE from dunnington's bli_kernel.h. This
      #undef was a temporary fix to some macro defaults which were being applied
      in the wrong order, which was recently fixed.

Author: Field G. Van Zee <field@cs.utexas.edu>

    Implemented developer-configurable malloc()/free().
    
    Details:
    - Replaced all instances of bli_malloc() and bli_free() with one of:
      - bli_malloc_pool()/bli_free_pool()
      - bli_malloc_user()/bli_free_user()
      - bli_malloc_intl()/bli_free_intl()
      each of which can be configured to call malloc()/free() substitutes,
      so long as the substitute functions have the same function type
      signatures as malloc() and free() defined by C's stdlib.h. The _pool()
      function is called when allocating blocks for the memory pools (used
      for packing buffers, primarily), the _user() function is called when
      obj_t's are created (via bli_obj_create() and friends), and the _intl()
      function is called for internal use by BLIS, such as when creating
      control tree nodes or temporary buffers for manipulating internal data
      structures. Substitutes for any of the three types of bli_malloc() may
      be specified by #defining the following pairs of cpp macros in
      bli_kernel.h:
      - BLIS_MALLOC_POOL/BLIS_FREE_POOL
      - BLIS_MALLOC_USER/BLIS_FREE_USER
      - BLIS_MALLOC_INTL/BLIS_FREE_INTL
      to be the name of the substitute functions. (Obviously, the object
      code that contains these functions must be provided at link-time.)
      These macros default to malloc() and free(). Subsitute functions are
      also automatically prototyped by BLIS (in bli_malloc_prototypes.h).
    - Removed definitions for bli_malloc() and bli_free().
    - Note that bli_malloc_pool() and bli_malloc_user() are now defined in
      terms of a new function, bli_malloc_align(), which aligns memory to an
      arbitrary (power of two) alignment boundary, but does so manually,
      whereas before alignment was performed behind the scenes by
      posix_memalign(). Currently, bli_malloc_intl() is defined in terms
      of bli_malloc_noalign(), which serves as a simple wrapper to the
      designated function that is passed in (e.g. BLIS_MALLOC_INTL).
      Similarly, there are bli_free_align() and bli_free_noalign(), which
      are used in concert with their bli_malloc_*() counterparts.

    Added alignment switch to testsuite.
    
    Details:
    - Added a new input parameter to input.general that globally toggles
      whether testsuite tests are performed on objects whose buffers and
      leading dimensions have been aligned, and changed the implementation
      of libblis_test_mobj_create() to employ alignment (or not) regardless
      of whether row, column, or general storage is being tested.
    - Updated configure script's "--help" text to indicate default behavior
      for internal integer type size and BLAS/CBLAS integer type size
      options.

    Generate prototypes for user-defined packm kernels.
    
    Details:
    - Created template prototypes for packm kernels (in bli_l1m_ker.h), and
      then redefined reference packm kernels' prototyping headers in terms of
      this template, as is already done for level-1v, -1f, and -3 kernels.
    - Automatically generate prototypes for user-defined packm kernels in
      bli_kernel_prototypes.h (using the new template prototypes in
      bli_l1m_ker.h).
    - Defined packm kernel function types in bli_l1m_ft.h, including for
      packm kernels specific to induced methods, which are now used in
      bli_packm_cxk.c and friends rather than using a locally-defined
      function type.
    - In bli_packm_cxk.c, extended function pointer for packm kernels array
      from out to index 31 (from previous maximum of 17). This allows us to
      store the unrolled 30xk kernel in the array for use (on knc, for
      example). Note: This should have been done a long time ago.

    Fixed bli_get_range_*() bugs in trsm variants.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed incorrect calls to bli_get_range_*() from within trsm blocked
      variants 1f, 2b, and 2f. The bug somehow went undetected since the
      big commit (537a1f4), and, strangely, did not manifest via the BLIS
      testsuite. The bug finally came to our attention when running thei
      libflame test suite while linking to BLIS. Thanks to Kiran Varaganti
      for submitting the initial report that led to this bug.

      #including "blis.h" from an application or library that already
      #includes an "f2c.h" header.

      the proper permanent fix.
    - Moved frame/1f/kernels/bli_dotxaxpyf_ref_var1.c out of the compilation
      path (into 'other' directory). _ref_var2 is used by default, which is

    Use 'restrict' in all kernel APIs; wspace changes.
    
    Details:
    - Updated level-1v, level-1f kernel function types (bli_l1?_ft.h) and
      generic kernel prototypes (bli_l1?_ker.h) to use 'restrict' for all
      numerical operand pointers (ie: all pointers except the cntx_t).
    - Updated level-1f reference kernel definitions to use 'restrict' for
      all numerical operand pointers. (Level-1v reference kernel definitions
      were already updated in bdbda6e.)
    - Rewrote the level-1v and level-1f reference kernel prototypes in
      bli_l1v_ref.h and bli_l1f_ref.h, respectively, to simply #include
      bli_l1v_ker.h and bli_l1f_ker.h with redefined function base names
      (as was already being done for the level-3 micro-kernel prototypes
      in bli_l3_ref.h), rather than duplicate the signatures from the
      _ker.h files.
    - Added definitions to frame/include/bli_kernel_prototypes.h for axpbyv
      and xpbyv, which were probably meant for inclusion in bdbda6e.
    - Converted a number of instances of four spaces, as introduced in
      bdbda6e, to tabs.

    Clear level-3 cntx_t's via memset() before use.
    
    Details:
    - In all level-3 operations' _cntx_init() functions, replaced calls to
      bli_cntx_obj_init() with calls to bli_cntx_obj_clear(), and in all
      level-3 operations' _cntx_finalize() functions, removed calls to
      bli_cntx_obj_finalize(), leaving those function definitions empty.
    - Changed the definition of bli_cntx_obj_clear() so that the clearing
      occurs via a single call to memset().

    Add configure options and generate bli_config.h automatically.
    
    Options to configure have been added for:
    - Setting the internal BLIS and BLAS/CBLAS integer sizes.
    - Enabling and disabling the BLAS and CBLAS layers.
    
    Additionally, configure options which require defining macros (the above plus the threading model), write their macros to the automatically-generated bli_config.h file in the top-level build directory. The old bli_config.h files in the config dirs were removed, and any kernel-related macros (SIMD size and alignment etc.) were moved to bli_kernel.h. The Makefiles were also modified to find the new bli_config.h file.
    
    Lastly, support for OMP in clang has been added (closes #56).

    Use kernel CFLAGS on "ukernels" directories.
    
    Details:
    - Updated the top-level Makefile so that the CFLAGS variable designated
      for kernel source code is applied not only to source code in
      directories named "kernels" but source code in any directory that
      contains the substring "kernels", such as "ukernels".
    - Formally disabled some code in gen-make-frag.sh script that was already
      effectively disabled. The code was related to handling "noopt" and
      "kernel" directories, which is now handled independently within the
      top-level Makefile without needing to place these source files into
      a spearate makefile variable.

    Implemented runtime contexts and reorganized code.
    
    Details:
    - Retrofitted a new data structure, known as a context, into virtually
      all internal APIs for computational operations in BLIS. The structure
      is now present within the type-aware APIs, as well as many supporting
      utility functions that require information stored in the context. User-
      level object APIs were unaffected and continue to be "context-free,"
      however, these APIs were duplicated/mirrored so that "context-aware"
      APIs now also exist, differentiated with an "_ex" suffix (for "expert").
      These new context-aware object APIs (along with the lower-level, type-
      aware, BLAS-like APIs) contain the the address of a context as a last
      parameter, after all other operands. Contexts, or specifically, cntx_t
      object pointers, are passed all the way down the function stack into
      the kernels and allow the code at any level to query information about
      the runtime, such as kernel addresses and blocksizes, in a thread-
      friendly manner--that is, one that allows thread-safety, even if the
      original source of the information stored in the context changes at
      run-time; see next bullet for more on this "original source" of info).
      (Special thanks go to Lee Killough for suggesting the use of this kind
      of data structure in discussions that transpired during the early
      planning stages of BLIS, and also for suggesting such a perfectly
      appropriate name.)
    - Added a new API, in frame/base/bli_gks.c, to define a "global kernel
      structure" (gks). This data structure and API will allow the caller to
      initialize a context with the kernel addresses, blocksizes, and other
      information associated with the currently active kernel configuration.
      The currently active kernel configuration within the gks cannot be
      changed (for now), and is initialized with the traditional cpp macros
      that define kernel function names, blocksizes, and the like. However,
      in the future, the gks API will be expanded to allow runtime management
      of kernels and runtime parameters. The most obvious application of this
      new infrastructure is the runtime detection of hardware (and the
      implied selection of appropriate kernels). With contexts in place,
      kernels may even be "hot swapped" at runtime within the gks. Once
      execution enters a level-3 _front() function, the memory allocator will
      be reinitialized on-the-fly, if necessary, to accommodate the new
      kernels' blocksizes. If another application thread is executing with
      another (previously loaded) kernel, it will finish in a deterministic
      fashion because its kernel information was loaded into its context
      before computation began, and also because the blocks it checked out
      from the internal memory pools will be unaffected by the newer threads'
      reinitialization of the allocator.
    - Reorganized and streamlined the 'ind' directory, which contains much of
      the code enabling use of induced methods for complex domain matrix
      multiplication; deprecated bli_bsv_query.c and bli_ukr_query.c, as
      those APIs' functionality is now mostly subsumed within the global
      kernel structure.
    - Updated bli_pool.c to define a new function, bli_pool_reinit_if(),
      that will reinitialize a memory pool if the necessary pool block size
      has increased.
    - Updated bli_mem.c to use bli_pool_reinit_if() instead of
      bli_pool_reinit() in the definition of bli_mem_pool_init(), and placed
      usage of contexts where appropriate to communicate cache and register
      blocksizes to bli_mem_compute_pool_block_sizes().
    - Simplified control trees now that much of the information resides in
      the context and/or the global kernel structure:
      - Removed blocksize object pointers (blksz_t*) fields from all control
        tree node definitions and replaced them with blocksize id (bszid_t)
        values instead, which may be passed into a context query routine in
        order to extract the corresponding blocksize from the given context.
      - Removed micro-kernel function pointers (func_t*) fields from all
        control tree node definitions. Now, any code that needs these function
        pointers can query them from the local context, as identified by a
        level-3 micro-kernel id (l3ukr_t), level-1f kernel id, (l1fkr_t), or
        level-1v kernel id (l1vkr_t).
      - Removed blksz_t object creation and initialization, as well as kernel
        function object creation and initialization, from all operation-
        specific control tree initialization files (bli_*_cntl.c), since this
        information will now live in the gks and, secondarily, in the context.
    - Removed blocksize multiples from blksz_t objects. Now, we track
      blocksize multiples for each blocksize id (bszid_t) in the context
      object.
    - Removed the bool_t's that were required when a func_t was initialized.
      These bools are meant to allow one to track the micro-kernel's storage
      preferences (by rows or columns). This preference is now tracked
      separately within the gks and contexts.
    - Merged and reorganized many separate-but-related functions into single
      files. This reorganization affects frame/0, 1, 1d, 1m, 1f, 2, 3, and
      util directories, but has the most obvious effect of allowing BLIS
      to compile noticeably faster.
    - Reorganized execution paths for level-1v, -1d, -1m, and -2 operations
      in an attempt to reduce overhead for memory-bound operations. This
      includes removal of default use of object-based variants for level-2
      operations. Now, by default, level-2 operations will directly call a
      low-level (non-object based) loop over a level-1v or -1f kernel.
    - Converted many common query functions in blk_blksz.c (renamed from
      bli_blocksize.c) and bli_func.c into cpp macros, now defined in their
      respective header files.
    - Defined bli_mbool.c API to create and query "multi-bools", or
      heterogeneous bool_t's (one for each floating-point datatype), in the
      same spirit as blksz_t and func_t.
    - Introduced two key parameters of the hardware: BLIS_SIMD_NUM_REGISTERS
      and BLIS_SIMD_SIZE. These values are needed in order to compute a third
      new parameter, which may be set indirectly via the aforementioned
      macros or directly: BLIS_STACK_BUF_MAX_SIZE. This value is used to
      statically allocate memory in macro-kernels and the induced methods'
      virtual kernels to be used as temporary space to hold a single
      micro-tile. These values are now output by the testsuite. The default
      value of BLIS_STACK_BUF_MAX_SIZE is computed as
      "2 * BLIS_SIMD_NUM_REGISTERS * BLIS_SIMD_SIZE".
    - Cleaned up top-level 'kernels' directory (for example, renaming the
      embarrassingly misleading "avx" and "avx2" directories to "sandybridge"
      and "haswell," respectively, and gave more consistent and meaningful
      names to many kernel files (as well as updating their interfaces to
      conform to the new context-aware kernel APIs).
    - Updated the testsuite to query blocksizes from a locally-initialized
      context for test modules that need those values: axpyf, dotxf,
      dotxaxpyf, gemm_ukr, gemmtrsm_ukr, and trsm_ukr.
    - Reformatted many function signatures into a standard format that will
      more easily facilitate future API-wide changes.
    - Updated many "mxn" level-0 macros (ie: those used to inline double loops
      for level-1m-like operations on small matrices) in frame/include/level0
      to use more obscure local variable names in an effort to avoid variable
      shaddowing. (Thanks to Devin Matthews for pointing these gcc warnings,
      which are only output using -Wshadow.)
    - Added a conj argument to setm, so that its interface now mirrors that
      of scalm. The semantic meaning of the conj argument is to optionally
      allow implicit conjugation of the scalar prior to being populated into
      the object.
    - Deprecated all type-aware mixed domain and mixed precision APIs. Note
      that this does not preclude supporting mixed types via the object APIs,
      where it produces absolutely zero API code bloat.

    Included missing blas2blis integer def to CBLAS.
    
    Details:
    - Added #include "bli_config_macro_defs" to all cblas_*.c files in
      compat/cblas/src. This has the effect of defining
      BLIS_BLAS2BLIS_INT_TYPE_SIZE to the default value if bli_config.h does
      not define it. Thanks to Tony Kelman for reporting this bug.
    - In cblas_i?amax.c, changed the type of the variable 'iamax' from 'int'
      to 'f77_int'. This eliminates a compiler warning and a potential
      runtime bug and/or crash when the size of an int differs from the size
      of f77_int (as determined by BLIS_BLAS2BLIS_INT_TYPE_SIZE).

    - Updated all induced method _cntl_init() functions in frame/cntl/ind/

    - Defined two new macros, bli_is_ind_packed() and bli_is_nat_packed(),

    Minor changes to treatment of rs, cs in bli_obj.c.
    
    Details:
    - Applied a patch submitted by Devin Matthews that:
      - implements subtle changes to handling of somewhat unusual cases of
        row and column strides to accommodate certail tensor cases, which
        includes adding dimension parameters to _is_col_tilted() and
        _is_row_tilted() macros,
      - simplifies how buffers are sized when requested BLIS-allocated
        objects,
      - re-consolidates bli_adjust_strides_*() into one function, and
      - defines 'restrict' keyword as a "nothing" macro for C++ and pre-C99
        environments.

    Fixed unimplemented case in core2 sgemm ukernel.
    
    Details:
    - Implemented the "beta == 0" case for general stride output for the
      dunnington sgemm micro-kernel. This case had been, up until now,
      identical to the "beta != 0" case, which does not work when the
      output matrix has nan's and inf's. It had manifested as nan residuals
      in the test suite for right-side tests of ctrsm4m1a. Thanks to Devin
      Matthews for reporting this bug.

    Fixed minor bugs for uncommon obj_create cases.
    
    Details:
    - Separated bli_adjust_strides() into _alloc() and _attach() flavors so
      that the latter can avoid a test performed by the former, in which the
      rs and cs are overridden and set to zero if either matrix dimension is
      zero. Actually, we also disable this overridding behavior, even for the
      _alloc() case, since keeping the original strides (probably) does not
      hurt anything. The original code has been kept commented-out, though,
      in case an unintended consequence is later discovered.
    - Fixed a typo in an error check for general stride cases where rs == cs.

    Fixed imaginary bug in quadratic partitioning code.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in the relatively new quadratic partitioning code that,
      under the right conditions, would perform sqrt() on a negative value.
      If the solution is imaginary, we discard it and use an alternate
      partition width that assumes no diagonal intersection. That alternate
      width is actually already computed, so, the fix was quite simple.
      Thanks to Devangi Parikh for reporting this bug.

    Laid groundwork for runtime memory pool resizing.
    
    Details:
    - Changed bli_pool_finalize() so that the freeing begins with the block
      at top_index instead of block 0. This allows us to use the function
      for terminal finalization as well as temporary cleanup prior to
      reinitialization. Also, clear the pool_t struct upon _pool_finalize()
      in case it is called in the terminal case with some blocks still
      checked out to threads (in which case the threads will see the new
      block size as 0 and thus release the block as intended).
    - Added bli_pool_reinit(), which calls _pool_finalize() followed by
      _pool_init() with new parameters.
    - Added bli_mem_reinit(), which is based on bli_pool_reinit().
    - Added new wrapper, _mem_compute_pool_block_sizes(), which calls
      _mem_compute_pool_block_sizes_dt().
    - Updated bli_mem_release() so that the pblk_t is freed, via
      _pool_free_block(), if the block size recorded in the mem_t at the
      time the pblk_t was acquired is now different from the value in the
      pool_t.

    Fixed obscure 3m1/4m1a bugs in trmm[3] and trsm.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a family of bugs in the triangular level-3 operations for
      certain complex implementations (3m1 and 4m1a) that only manifest if
      one of the register blocksizes (PACKMR/PACKNR, actually) is odd:
      - Fixed incorrect imaginary stride computation in bli_packm_blk_var2()
        for the triangular case.
      - Fixed the incorrect computation of imaginary stride, as stored in
        the auxinfo_t struct in trmm and trsm macro-kernels.
      - Fixed incorrect pointer arithmetic in the trsm macro-kernels in the
        cases where the the register blocksize for the triangular matrix is
        odd. Introduced a new byte-granular pointer arithmetic macro,
        bli_ptr_add(), that computes the correct value.
    - Added cpp macro to bli_macro_defs.h for typeof() operator, defined in
      terms of __typeof__, which is used by bli_ptr_add() macro.
    - Disabled the row- vs. column-storage optimization in bli_trmm_front()
      for singleton problems because the inherent ambiguity of whether a
      scalar is row-stored or column-stored causes the wrong parameter
      combination code to be executed (by dumb luck of our checking for
      row storage first).
    - Added commented-out debugging lines to 3m1/4m1a and reference
      micro-kernels, and trsm_ll macro-kernel.

    Load balance thread ranges for arbitrary diagonals.
    
    Details:
    - Expanded/updated interface for bli_get_range_weighted() and
      bli_get_range() so that the direction of movement is specified in the
      function name (e.g. bli_get_range_l2r(), bli_get_range_weighted_t2b())
      and also so that the object being partitioned is passed instead of an
      uplo parameter. Updated invocations in level-3 blocked variants, as
      appropriate.
    - (Re)implemented bli_get_range_*() and bli_get_range_weighted_*() to
      carefully take into account the location of the diagonal when computing
      ranges so that the area of each subpartition (which, in all present
      level-3 operations, is proportional to the amount of computation
      engendered) is as equal as possible.
    - Added calls to a new class of routines to all non-gemm level-3 blocked
      variants:
        bli_<oper>_prune_unref_mparts_[mnk]()
      where <oper> is herk, trmm, or trsm and [mnk] is chosen based on which
      dimension is being partitioned. These routines call a more basic
      routine, bli_prune_unref_mparts(), to prune unreferenced/unstored
      regions from matrices and simultaneously adjust other matrices which
      share the same dimension accordingly.
    - Simplified herk_blk_var2f, trmm_blk_var1f/b as a result of more the
      new pruning routines.
    - Fixed incorrect blocking factors passed into bli_get_range_*() in
      bli_trsm_blk_var[12][fb].c
    - Added a new test driver in test/thread_ranges that can exercise the new
      bli_get_range_*() and bli_get_range_weighted_*() under a range of
      conditions.
    - Reimplemented m and n fields of obj_t as elements in a "dim"
      array field so that dimensions could be queried via index constant
      (e.g. BLIS_M, BLIS_N). Adjusted/added query and modification
      macros accordingly.
    - Defined mdim_t type to enumerate BLIS_M and BLIS_N indexing values.
    - Added bli_round() macro, which calls C math library function round(),
      and bli_round_to_mult(), which rounds a value to the nearest multiple
      of some other value.
    - Added miscellaneous pruning- and mdim_t-related macros.
    - Renamed bli_obj_row_offset(), bli_obj_col_offset() macros to
      bli_obj_row_off(), bli_obj_col_off().

    Fixed minor alignment ambiguity bug in bli_pool.c.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a typecasting ambiguity in bli_pool_alloc_block() in which
      pointer arithmetic was performed on a void* as if it were a byte
      pointer (such as char*). Some compilers may have already been
      interpreting this situation as intended, despite the sloppiness.
      Thanks to Aleksei Rechinskii for reporting this issue.
    - Redefined pointer alignment macros to typecast to uintptr_t instead of
      siz_t.

      and FMA instructions. (Complex support is currently provided by default
      induced method, 4m1a.)
    - Added a 'haswell' configuration, which uses the aforementioned kernels.
    - Inserted auto-detection support for haswell configuration in
      build/auto-detect/cpuid_x86.c.
    - Modified configure script to explicitly echo when automatic or manual
      configuration is in progress.

    Implemented dynamic allocation for packing buffers.
    
    Details:
    - Replaced the old memory allocator, which was based on statically-
      allocated arrays, with one based on a new internal pool_t type, which,
      combined with a new bli_pool_*() API, provides a new abstract data
      type that implements the same memory pool functionality but with blocks
      from the heap (ie: malloc() or equivalent). Hiding the details of the
      pool in a separate API also allows for a much simpler bli_mem.c family
      of functions.
    - Added a new internal header, bli_config_macro_defs.h, which enables
      sane defaults for the values previously found in bli_config. Those
      values can be overridden by #defining them in bli_config.h the same
      way kernel defaults can be overridden in bli_kernel.h. This file most
      resembles what was previously a typical configuration's bli_config.h.
    - Added a new configuration macro, BLIS_POOL_ADDR_ALIGN_SIZE, which
      defaults to BLIS_PAGE_SIZE, to specify the alignment of individual
      blocks in the memory pool. Also added a corresponding query routine to
      the bli_info API.
    - Deprecated (once again) the micro-panel alignment feature. Upon further
      reflection, it seems that the goal of more predictable L1 cache
      replacement behavior is outweighed by the harm caused by non-contiguous
      micro-panels when k % kc != 0. I honestly don't think anyone will even
      miss this feature.
    - Changed bli_ukr_get_funcs() and bli_ukr_get_ref_funcs() to call
      bli_cntl_init() instead of bli_init().
    - Removed query functions from bli_info.c that are no longer applicable
      given the dynamic memory allocator.
    - Removed unnecessary definitions from configurations' bli_config.h files,
      which are now pleasantly sparse.
    - Fixed incorrect flop counts in addv, subv, scal2v, scal2m testsuite
      modules. Thanks to Devangi Parikh for pointing out these
      miscalculations.
    - Comment, whitespace changes.

    Added early return to API-level _init() routines.
    
    Details:
    - Added conditional code that returns early from the API-level _init()
      routines if the API is already initialized. Actually meant for this to
      be included in 5f93cbe8.

    Introduced API-level initialization.
    
    Details:
    - Added API-level initialization state to _const, _error, _mem, _thread,
      _ind, and _cntl APIs. While this functionality will mostly go unused,
      adding miniscule overhead at init-time, there will be at least once
      instance in the near future where, in order to avoid an infinite loop,
      a certain portion of the initialization will call a query function that
      itself attempts to call bli_init(). API-level initialization will allow
      this later stage to verify that an earlier stage of initialization has
      completed, even if the overall call to bli_init() has not yet returned.
    - Added _is_initialized() functions for each API, setting the underlying
      bool_t during _init() and unsetting it during _finalize().
    - Comment, whitespace changes.

commit ee129c6b028bc5ac88da7c74fde72c49803742ff
Author: Field G. Van Zee <field@cs.utexas.edu>
Date:   Wed Jun 10 12:53:28 2015 -0500

    Fixed bugs in _get_range(), _get_range_weighted().
    
    Details:
    - Fixed some bugs that only manifested in multithreaded instances of
      some (non-gemm) level-3 operations. The bugs were related to invalid
      allocation of "edge" cases to thread subpartitions. (Here, we define
      an "edge" case to be one where the dimension being partitioned for
      parallelism is not a whole multiple of whatever register blocksize
      is needed in that dimension.) In BLIS, we always require edge cases
      to be part of the bottom, right, or bottom-right subpartitions.
      (This is so that zero-padding only has to happen at the bottom, right,
      or bottom-right edges of micro-panels.) The previous implementations
      of bli_get_range() and _get_range_weighted() did not adhere to this
      implicit policy and thus produced bad ranges for some combinations of
      operation, parameter cases, problem sizes, and n-way parallelism.
    - As part of the above fix, the functions bli_get_range() and
      _get_range_weighted() have been renamed to use _l2r, _r2l, _t2b,
      and _b2t suffixes, similar to the partitioning functions. This is
      an easy way to make sure that the variants are calling the right
      version of each function. The function signatures have also been
      changed slightly.
    - Comment/whitespace updates.
    - Removed unnecessary '/' from macros in bli_obj_macro_defs.h.

    POSIX thread bugfixes/edits to bli_init.c, _mem.c.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a sort-of bug in bli_init.c whereby the wrong pthread mutex
      was used to lock access to initialization/finalization actions.
      But everything worked out okay as long as bli_init() was called by
      single-threaded code.
    - Changed to static initialization for memory allocator mutex in
      bli_mem.c, and moved mutex to that file (from bli_init.c).
    - Fixed some type mismatches in bli_threading_pthreads.c that resulted
      in compiler warnings.
    - Fixed a small memory leak with allocated-but-never-freed (and unused)
      pthread_attr_t objects.
    - Whitespace changes to bli_init.c and bli_mem.c.

      except with the latter's problem sizes adjusted so that problems are
      generated with equal flop counts.

    Fixed a packing bug that manifested in trsm_r.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug that caused a memory leak in the contiguous memory
      allocator. Because packm_init() was using simple aliasing when
      a subpartition object was marked as zeros by bli_acquire_mpart_*(),
      the "destination" pack object's mem_t entry was being overwritten
      by the corresponding field of the "source" object (which was likely
      NULL). This prevented the block from being released back to the
      memory allocator. But this bug only manifested when changing the
      location of packing B from outside the var1 loop to inside the
      var3 loop, and only for trsm with triangular B (side = right). The
      bug was fixed by changing the type of alias used in packm_init()
      when handling zero partition cases. Specifically, we now use
      bli_obj_alias_for_packing(), which does not clobber the destination
      (pack) object's mem_t field. Thanks to Devangi Parikh for this bug
      report.

    Implemented 3m2, 3m3 induced algorithms (gemm only).
    
    Details:
    - Defined a new "3ms" (separated 3m) pack schema and added appropriate
      support in packm_init(), packm_blk_var2().
    - Generalized packm_struc_cxk_3mi to take the imaginary stride (is_p)
      as an argument instead of computing it locally. Exception: for trmm,
      is_p must be computed locally, since it changes for triangular
      packed matrices. Also exposed is_p in interface to dt-specific
      packm_blk_var2 (and _var1, even though it does not use imaginary
      stride).
    - Renamed many functions/variables from _3mi to _3mis to indicate that
      they work for either interleaved or separated 3m pack schemas.
    - Generalized gemm and herk macro-kernels to pass in imaginary stride
      rather than compute them locally.
    - Added support for 3m2 and 3m3 algorithms to frame/ind, including 3m2-
      and 3m3-specific virtual micro-kernels.
    - Added special gemm macro-kernels to support 3m2 and 3m3.
    - Added support for 3m2 and 3m3 to testsuite.
    - Corrected the type of the panel dimension (pd_) in various macro-
      kernels from inc_t to dim_t.
    - Renamed many functions defined in bli_blocksize.c.
    - Moved most induced-related macro defs from frame/include to
      frame/ind/include.
    - Updated the _ukernel.c files so that the micro-kernel function pointers
      are obtained from the func_t objects rather than the cpp macros that
      define the function names.
    - Updated test/3m4m driver, Makefile, and run script.

    Reorganized code for induced complex methods.
    
    Details:
    - Consolidated most of the code relating to induced complex methods
      (e.g. 4mh, 4m1, 3mh, 3m1, etc.) into frame/ind. Induced methods
      are now enabled on a per-operation basis. The current "available"
      (enabled and implemented) implementation can then be queried on
      an operation basis. Micro-kernel func_t objects as well as blksz_t
      objects can also be queried in a similar maner.
    - Redefined several micro-kernel and operation-related functions in
      bli_info_*() API, in accordance with above changes.
    - Added mr and nr fields to blksz_t object, which point to the mr
      and nr blksz_t objects for each cache blocksize (and are NULL for
      register blocksizes). Renamed the sub-blocksize field "sub" to
      "mult" since it is really expressing a blocksize multiple.
    - Updated bli_*_determine_kc_[fb]() for gemm/hemm/symm, trmm, and
      trsm to correctly query mr and nr (for purposes of nudging kc).
    - Introduced an enumerated opid_t in bli_type_defs.h that uniquely
      identifies an operation. For now, only level-3 id values are defined,
      along with a generic, catch-all BLIS_NOID value.
    - Reworked testsuite so that all induced methods that are enabled
      are tested (one at a time) rather than only testing the first
      available method.
    - Reformated summary at the beginning of testsuite output so that
      blocksize and micro-kernel info is shown for each induced method
      that was requested (as well as native execution).
    - Reduced the number of columns needed to display non-matlab
      testsuite output (from approx. 90 to 80).

    Fixed bug in release of mem_t buffer.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug that affects all level-2 and level-3 blocked variants. The
      bug only manifested, however, if the packing of operands (A and B in
      gemm, for example) spanned multiple nodes in the control tree. Until
      recently, the main consumers of packm were level-3 operations, all of
      which packed both input operands from blocked variant 1 (B outside of
      the loop, and A within the loop). This particular usage masked a flaw
      in the code whereby bli_obj_release_pack() would always release the
      underlying mem_t buffer (provided it was allocated), even if the buffer
      was not allocated in the current variant. This has been fixed by
      replacing all calls to bli_obj_release_pack() with calls to a new
      function, bli_packm_release(), which takes the same control tree node
      argument passed into the object's corresponding call to packm_init()
      or packv_init(). bli_packm_release() then proceeds to invoke
      bli_obj_release_pack() only if the control tree node indicates that
      packing was requested. Thanks to Devangi Parikh for identifying this
      bug.

    Minor updates to induced complex mode management.
    
    Details:
    - Relocated bli_4mh.c, bli_4mb.c, bli_4m.c, bli_3mh.c, bli_3m.c (and
      associated headers) from frame/base to frame/base/induced.
    - Added bli_xm.? to frame/base/induced, which implements
      bli_xm_is_enabled(), which detects whether ANY induced complex method
      is currently enabled.
    - The new function bli_xm_is_enabled() is now used in bli_info.c to
      detect when an induced complex method is used, so we know when to
      return blocksizes from one of the induced methods' blocksize objects.

      of blocks of A and B. This formally accounts for the nudging of kc
      up to a multiple of mr or nr at runtime for triangular operations

    Renamed 3m and 4m symbols/macros to 3mi and 4mi.
    
    Details:
    - Renamed several variables and macros from 3m/4m to 3mi/4mi. This is
      because those packing schemas were always implicitly "interleaved".
      This new naming scheme will make way for new schemas that separate
      instead of interleve the real and imaginary (and summed) parts.
    - Expanded the pack format sub-field of the pack schema field of the
      info_t to 4 bits (from 3). This will allow for more schema types
      going forward.
    - Removed old _cntl.c files for herk3m, herk4m, trmm3m, trmm4m.

    Fixed indexing bug for trmm3 via 3mh, 4mh.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug that only affected trmm3 when performed via 3mh or 4mh,
      whereby micro-panels of the triangular matrix were packed with "dead
      space" between them due to failing to adjust for the fact that pointer
      arithmetic was occurring in units of complex elements while the data
      being packed consisted of real elements. It turns out that the macro-
      kernel suffered from the same bug, meaning the panels were actually
      being packed and read consistently. The only way I was able to
      discover the bug in the first place was because the packed block of A
      was overflowing into the beginning of the packed row panel of B using
      the sandybridge configuration.

    Fixed an obscure bug in 3mh/3m/4mh/4m packing.
    
    Details:
    - Modified bli_packm_blk_var1.c and _var2.c to increase the triangular
      case's panel increment by 1 if it would otherwise be odd. This is
      particularly necessary in _var2.c when handling the interleaved 3m
      or ro/io/rpi pack schemas, since division of an odd number by 2 can
      happen if both the panel length and the panel packing dimension
      (register packing blocksize) are odd, thus making their product odd.
    - Modified bli_packm_init.c so that panel strides are increased by 1
      if they would otherwise be odd, even for non-3m related packing.
    - Modified the trmm and trsm macro-kernels so that triangular packed
      micro-panels are traversed with this new "increment by 1 if odd"
      policy.
    - Added sanity checks in trmm and trsm macro-kernels that would result
      in an abort() if the conditions that would lead to a "divide odd
      integer by 2" scenario ever manifest.
    - Defined bli_is_odd(), _is_even() macros in bli_scalar_macro_defs.h.

    - Defined bli_obj_imag_stride() and bli_obj_set_imag_stride() and
      added invocations in key locations.
    - Added some basic error-checking related to imaginary stride.
    - For now, imaginary stride will not be exposed into the most-used
      BLIS APIs such as bli_obj_create(), and certainly not the
      computational APIs such as bli_dgemm().

    Defined gemm cntl function to query ukrs func_t.
    
    Details:
    - Added a new function, bli_gemm_cntl_ukrs(), that returns the func_t*
      for the gemm micro-kernels from the leaf node of the control tree.
      This allows all the func_t* fields from higher-level nodes in the tree
      to be NULL, which makes the function that builds the control trees
      slightly easier to read.
    - Call bli_gemm_cntl_ukrs() instead of the cntl_gemm_ukrs() macro in
      all bli_*_front() functions (which is needed to apply the row/column
      preference optimization).
    - In all level-3 bli_*_cntl_init() functions, changed the _obj_create()
      function arguments corresponding to the gemm_ukrs fields in higher-
      level cntl tree nodes to NULL.
    - Removed some old her2k macro-kernels.

    - Added optional flop counting to all level-3 front-ends, which is
      enabled via BLIS_ENABLE_FLOP_COUNT. The flop count can be
      reset at any time via bli_flop_count_reset() and queried via
      bli_flop_count(). Caveats:
      - flop counts are approximate for her[2]k, syr[2]k, trmm, and
        trsm operations;
      - flop counts ignore extra flops due to non-unit alpha;
      - flop counts do not account for situations where beta is zero.

      "4m_1b" fissures the first loop around the micro-kernel so that the
      real sub-panel of the current micro-panel of B is multiplied against
      (both sub-panels of) all micro-panels of A, before doing the same for
      the imaginary sub-panel of the micro-panel of B. For now, only gemm is
      supported, and 4m_1b (labeled "4mb" within the framework) is not yet
      integrated into the test suite.

    Fixed obscure level-2 packing / general stride bug.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in certain structured level-2 operations that manifested
      only when the structured matrix was provided to BLIS as matrix stored
      with general stride. The bug was introduced in c472993b when the
      densify field was removed from the packm control tree node and
      associated APIs. Since then, the packed object was unconditionally
      marked with an uplo field of BLIS_DENSE. This is fine for level-3
      operations where micro-panels are always densified, but in level-2
      contexts, the underlying unblocked variant (fused or unfused) of
      structured operations (e.g. trmv) still needs to know whether to
      execute its "lower" or "upper" branches of code. Since this field
      was unconditionally being set to BLIS_DENSE, the unblocked variants
      were always executed the "else" branch, which happened to be the
      "lower" case code. Thus, running an upper case produced the wrong
      answer. This most obviously manifested in the form of failures for
      trmm, trmm3, and trsm in the test suite.
      The bug was fixed by setting the packed object's uplo field to
      BLIS_DENSE only if the schema indicated that micro-panels were to be
      packed. Otherwise, we can assume we are packing to regular row or
      column storage, as is the case with level-2 packing. Thanks to
      Francisco Igual for reporting the testsuite failures and ultimately
      leading us to this bug.

    Removed KC constraint comments from _kernel.h files.
    
    Details:
    - Since 4674ca8c, the constraint that KC be a multiple of both MR and
      NR have been relaxed, and thus it was time to remove the comments
      from the top of the bli_kernel.h files of all configurations.

      for each datatype).
    - Updates and tweaks to piledriver configuration.
    - Added 3xk packm micro-kernel support.
    - Explicitly unrolled some of the smaller packm micro-kernels.
    - Added notes to avx/sandybridge and piledriver micro-kernel files
      acknowledging the influence of the corresponding kernel code in
      OpenBLAS.

    Added separeate micro-panel alignment for A and B.
    
    Details:
    - Changed the recently-added micro-panel alignment macros so that we now
      have two sets--one for micro-panels of matrix A and one for micro-
      panels of matrix B: BLIS_UPANEL_[AB]_ALIGN_SIZE_?.
    - Store each set of alignment values into a separate blksz_t object in
      bli_gemm_cntl_init().
    - Adjusted packm_init() to use the separate alignment values.
    - Added query routines for the new alignment values to bli_info.c.
    - Modified test suite output accordingly.

    Factored common code from blocksize functions.
    
    Details:
    - Split bli_determine_blocksize_[fb]() into two functions each, the
      newer ones ending with the _sub suffix. These new sub-functions are
      now called from bli_[gemm|trmm|trsm]_determine_kc_[fb](), which
      eliminates redundant code and will allow any future tweaks to the
      core sub-functions to automatically be inherited by the operation-
      specific versions.

    Extended newly relaxed KC to hemm, symm.
    
    Details:
    - These changes were intended for the previous commit.
    - Defined bli_gemm_determine_kc_[fb]() and bli_gemm_determine_kc_[fb](),
      which determine blocksizes for gemm-based operations, taking special
      care to "nudge" the kc dimension up to a multiple of MR or NR for
      hemm and symm operations, as needed.
    - Changed bli_gemm_blk_var3f.c to call bli_gemm_determine_kc_f().
      instead of bli_determine_blocksize_f().
    - Comment updates to bli_trmm_blocksize.c, bli_trsm_blocksize.c.

Author: Field G. Van Zee <field@cs.utexas.edu>
Date:   Wed Oct 22 17:21:58 2014 -0500

    Relaxed constraint that KC be multiple of MR, NR.
    
    Details:
    - Relaxed a long-held requirement in register blocksizes that required
      the kernel programmer to choose a KC that was divisible by both MR
      and NR. This was very constraining on some architectures that did not
      use register blocksizes that were powers of two. The constraint is
      now enforced only for trmm and trsm, where it is needed, and it is
      now handled by "nudging" kc upward at runtime, if necessary, to be a
      multiple of MR or NR, as needed.
    - Defined bli_trmm_determine_kc_[fb]() and bli_trsm_determine_kc_[fb](),
      which determine blocksizes for trmm and trsm, taking special care to
      "nudge" the kc dimension up to a multiple of MR or NR, as needed.
    - Changed bli_trmm_blk_var3[fb].c to call bli_trmm_determine_kc_[fb]()
      instead of bli_determine_blocksize_[fb]().
    - Added safeguard to bli_align_dim_to_mult() that returns the dimension
      unmodified if the dimension multiple is zero (to avoid division by
      zero).
    - Removed cpp guard/check for KC % MR == 0 and KC % NR == 0 from
      bli_kernel_macro_defs.h.
    - Whitespace, variable name changes to bli_blocksize.c.
    - Removed old commented code from bli_gemm_cntl.c.

commit e64dba5633fc49b768b5edc7762f2b5d8a4d0588
Author: Field G. Van Zee <field@cs.utexas.edu>
Date:   Mon Oct 20 19:23:06 2014 -0500

    Re-implemented micro-panel alignment.
    
    Details:
    - This commit re-implements a feature that was removed in commit
      c2b2ab62. It was removed because, at the time, I wasn't sure how the
      micro-panel alignment feature would interact with the 4m method (when
      applied at the micro-kernrel level), and so it seemed safer to disable
      the feature entirely rather than allow possible breakage. This commit
      revisits the issue and safely re-implements the feature in a way that
      is compatible with 4m, 3m, 4mh, and 3mh (and native execution).
    - Modified the static memory pool to account for micro-panel alignment
      space.
    - Modified packm_init and blocked variants to align whole micro-panels
      by a datatype-specific alignment value that may be set by the
      configuration. (If it is not set by the configuration, it will default
      to BLIS_SIZEOF_?.)
    - Modified macro-kernels so that:
      - storage stride is handled properly given the new micro-panel
        alignment behavior;
      - indexing through 3m/4m/rih-type sub-panels, as is done by trmm and
        trsm, is more robust (e.g. will work if the applicable packing
        register blocksize is odd);
      - imaginary strides are computed and stored within auxinfo_t structs,
        which allows the virtual micro-kernels to more easily determine how
        to index into the micro-panel operands.
    - Modified virtual 3m and 4m micro-kernels to use the imaginary strides
      within the auxinfo_t structs instead of panel strides.
    - Deprecated the panel stride fields from the auxinfo_t structs.
    - Updated test suite to print out the micro-panel alignment values.

      as well as assembly-based and OpenBLAS implementations of gemm
      in single and multithreaded modes.

    Details:
    - As intended for previous commit, the new definition of
      bli_is_last_iter() is now disabled in favor of the old
      definition.

Author: Field G. Van Zee <field@cs.utexas.edu>
Date:   Fri Oct 17 11:19:34 2014 -0500

    Minor changes and fixes.
    
    Details:
    - Redefined bli_is_last_iter() to take thread_id and num_thread
      arguments, which allows the macro to correctly compute whether a
      given iteration is the last that the thread will compute in that
      particular loop. The new definition, however, remains disabled
      (commented out) until someone can look at this more closely, as
      the new definition seems to actually hurt performance slightly.
    - Whitespace and related updates to level-3 macro-kernels.
    - Updated test suite so that performance results in the hundreds of
      gigaflops does not disrupt the column alignment of the output.

    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in the test suite for the trsm_ukr and gemmtrsm_ukr test
      modules whereby the uplo bits of some packed matrix objects were not
      being set properly, resulting in false FAILURE results for those
      tests. Thanks to Tyler Smith for bringing this issue to my attention.
    - Fixed a bug in bli_obj_alloc_buffer() that caused an unnecessary
      "not yet implemented" abort() when creating a 1x1 object with non-unit
      strides.

    Fixed a bug in the pack schema-related bit macros.
    
    Details:
    - Expanded the BLIS_PACK_SCHEMA_BITS value in bli_type_defs.h to
      include all six bits presently used in the pack schema bitfield of
      the info field of obj_t structs. Prior to this commit, the macro
      constant only included the lowest five bits, which excluded the
      "is or is not packed" bit. This manifested as a strange bug in
      probably many level-2 codes that invoked packing, though we only
      observed it in ger before fixing. Thanks to Devin Matthews for
      finding and reporting this bug.

    Details:
    - We actually need to check alignment of lda*sizeof(double) and NOT
      a+lda because in the latter case, alignment could cancel out and
      still allow the optimized code to run when it shouldn't. Thanks
      to Devin for pointing this out.

    Details:
    - The bugfix in a68b316c was inadvertantly checkin alignment of the

    Added high-level implementations of 4m, 3m.
    
    Details:
    - Added "4mh" and "3mh" APIs, which implement the 4m and 3m methods at
      high levels, respectively. APIs for trmm and trsm were NOT added due
      to the fact that these approaches are inherently incompatible with
      implementing 4m or 3m at high levels (because the input right-hand
      side matrix is overwritten).
    - Added 4mh, 3mh virtual micro-kernels, and updated the existing 4m and
      3m so that all are stylistically consistent.
    - Added new "rih" packing kernels (both low-level and structure-aware)
      to support both 4mh and 3mh.
    - Defined new pack_t schemas to support real-only, imaginary-only, and
      real+imaginary packing formats.
    - Added various level0 scalar macros to support the rih packm kernels.
    - Minor tweaks to trmm macro-kernels to facilitate 4mh and 3mh.
    - Added the ability to enable/disable 4mh, 3m, and 3mh, and adjusted
      level-3 front-ends to check enabledness of 3mh, 3m, 4mh, and 4m (in
      that order) and execute the first one that is enabled, or the native
      implementation if none are enabled.
    - Added implementation query functions for each level-3 operation so
      that the user can query a string that describes the implementation
      that is currently enabled.
    - Updated test suite to output implementation types for reach level-3
      operation, as well as micro-kernel types for each of the five micro-
      kernels.
    - Renamed BLIS_ENABLE_?COMPLEX_VIA_4M macros to _ENABLE_VIRTUAL_?COMPLEX.
    - Fixed an obscure bug when packing Hermitian matrices (regular packing
      type) whereby the diagonal elements of the packed micro-panels could
      get tainted if the source matrix's imaginary diagonal part contained
      garbage.

    Pass pack_t schemas into ukernels via auxinfo_t.
    
    Details:
    - Modified macro-kernels to pass the pack_t schema values for matrices
      A and B into the datatype-specific functions, where they are now
      inserted into a newly-expanded auxinfo_t struct. This gives gives the
      micro-kernels access to the pack_t schema values embedded in the
      control trees, which determine the precise format into which the
      matrix elements are packed.
    - Updated a call to bli_packm_init_pack() in src/test_libblis.c to
      remove densify argument. Meant to include this in commit c472993b.

    Removed densify argument to packm_cntl_obj_create().
    
    Details:
    - Removed the "densify" bool_t argument to bli_packm_cntl_obj_create().
      This argument was inserted very early in BLIS's development, when it
      was anticipated that the developer may sometimes wish to pack a
      Hermitian, symmetric, or triangular matrix without making it dense.
      But as it turns out, if we are packing a matrix, we always want to
      make it dense in some way or another due to the fact that the micro-
      kernel only multiplies dense micro-panels. Thus, unless/until there
      is a real need for the feature, it seems reasonable to remove it from
      the packm_cntl API.

    Retired trmm_t control tree definitions, usage.
    
    Details:
    - Replaced all trmm_t control tree instances and usage with that of
      gemm_t. This change is similar to the recent retirement of the herk_t
      control tree.
    - Tweaked packm blocked variants so that the triangular code does NOT
      assume that k is a multiple of MR (when A is triangular) or NR (when
      B is triangular). This means that bottom-right micro-panels packed for
      trmm will have different zero-padding when k is not already a multiple
      of the relevant register blocksize. While this creates a seemingly
      arbitrary and unnecessary distinction between trmm and trsm packing,
      it actually allows trmm to be handled with one control tree, instead
      of one for left and one for right side cases. Furthermore, since only
      one tree is required, it can now be handled by the gemm tree, and thus
      the trmm control tree definitions can be disposed of entirely.
    - Tweaked trmm macro-kernels so that they do NOT inflate k up to a
      multiple of MR (when A is triangular) or NR (when B is triangular).
    - Misc. tweaks and cleanups to bli_packm_struc_cxk_4m.c and _3m.c, some
      of which are to facilitate above-mentioned changes whereby k is no
      longer required to be a multiple of register blocksize when packing
      triangular micro-panels.
    - Adjusted trmm3 according to above changes.
    - Retired trmm_t control tree creation/initialization functions.

    Retired herk_t control tree definitions, usage.
    
    Details:
    - Replaced all herk_t control tree instances and usage with that of
      gemm_t, since the two types presently have the same fields. This means
      that herk, her2k, syrk, and syr2k can simply use the gemm control tree
      as-is, just as hemm and symm have been doing for some time now.
    - Retired herk_t control tree creation/initialization functions.
    - Retired many _target.c and .h files into 'old' directories.

      respectively, in packm_cxk, packm_cxk_3m, packm_cxk_4m kernel wrapper
      functions. This makes the code a little easier to read since "m" and

    Retired portions of bli_kernel_3m/4m_macro_defs.h.
    
    Details:
    - Removed sections of bli_kernel_[4m|3m]_macro_defs.h that defined
      4m/3m-specific blocksizes after realizing that this can be done in
      bli_gemm[4m|3m]_cntl.c, since that is (mostly) the only place they
      are used.
    - The maximum cache values for 4m/3m are stll needed when computing mem
      pool dimensions in bli_mem_pool_macro_defs.h. As a workaround, "local"
      definitions in terms of the regular cache blocksizes are now in place.
    - Similarly, the register blocksizes for 4m/3m are still needed in
      bli_kernel_post_macro_defs.h. As a workaround, "local" definitions in
      terms of the regular register blocksizes are now in place.

    Changed semantics of blocksize extensions.
    
    Details:
    - Changed semantics of cache and register blocksize extensions so that
      the extended values are tracked, rather than just the marginal
      extensions.
    - BLIS_EXTEND_[MKN]C_? has been renamed BLIS_MAXIMUM_[MKN]C_?.
    - BLIS_EXTEND_[MKN]R_? has been renamed BLIS_PACKDIM_[MKN]R_?.
    - bli_blksz_ext_*() APIs have been renamed to bli_blksz_max_*(). Note
      that these "max" query routines grab the maximum value for cache
      blocksizes and the packdim value for register blocksizes.
    - bli_info_*() API has been updated accordingly.
    - All configurations have been updated accordingly.

    Details:
    - Changed the interface to the packm_struc_cxk*() kernels to include
      the pack_t schema. This allows the implementation to more easily
      determine how the micro-panel is stored (row-stored column panel
      or column-stored row panel).
    - Updated packm blocked variants to pass in the schema.
    - Updated packm_ker_t function pointer definition accordingly.

    Reorganized packm implementation.
    
    Details:
    - Reorganized packm variants and structure-aware kernels so that all
      routines for a given pack format (4m, 3m, regular) reside in a single
      file.
    - Renamed _blk_var4 to _blk_var2 and generalized so that it will work
      for
      both 4m and 3m, and adjusted 4m/3m _cntl_init() functions accordingly.
    - Added a new packm_ker_t function pointer type to
      bli_kernel_type_defs.h
      to facilitate function pointer typecasting in the datatype-specific
      packm_blk_var2() functions.
    - Deprecated _blk_var3.
    - Fixed a bug in the triangular micro-panel packing facility that
      affected trmm and trmm3 with unit diagonals.

      we now pass in the pack schema itself.

    Details:
    - The packm implementation (i.e. sources files in frame/1m/packm and
      frame/1m/packm/ukernels), interchangeably used the names "beta" and
      "kappa" to refer to the optional scalar to be applied during packing.
      This commit renames all uses of "beta" to be "kappa", since "beta"
      sometimes evokes the scalar specifically on the output matrix of a
      level-2 or level-3 operation.

      the fact that the function was previously named
      bli_obj_init_scalar_copy_of() and the name change, performed in

    Cleaned up front-end layering for 4m/3m.
    
    Details:
    - Added an extra layer to level-3 front-ends (examples: bli_gemm_entry()
      and bli_gemm4m_entry()) to hide the control trees from the code that
      decides whether to execute native or 4m-based implementations. The
      layering was also applied to 3m.
    - Branch to 4m code based on the return value of bli_4m_is_enabled(),
      rather than the cpp macros BLIS_ENABLE_?COMPLEX_VIA_4M. This lays
      the groundwork for users to be able to change at runtime which
      implementation is called by the main front-ends (e.g. bli_gemm()).
    - Retired some experimental gemm code that hadn't been touched in
      months.

    Added bli_4m API for querying 4m enabled state.
    
    Details:
    - Added bli_4m.c (and header), which defines a simple API that can be
      used to query, enable, and disable 4m-based complex support in BLIS.
      The macros BLIS_ENABLE_?COMPLEX_VIA_4M are now used to initialize
      the variable that determines the state (enabled or disabled).
    - Changed bli_info*() API so that all cache and register blocksize-
      related query routines return the blksz_t objects' values as they
      exist at runtime, rather than return the values as determined by the
      configuration system (e.g. bli_kernel.h, or defaults for those values
      not specified). This sets the foundation for being able to change
      those blocksizes at runtime.

    Added optional row preference to ukernel config.
    
    Details:
    - Added the ability for the kernel developer to indicate the gemm micro-
      kernel as having a preference for accessing the micro-tile of C via
      contiguous rows (as opposed to contiguous columns). This property may
      be encoded in bli_kernel.h as BLIS_?GEMM_UKERNEL_PREFERS_CONTIG_ROWS,
      which may be defined or left undefined. Leaving it undefined leads to
      the default assumption of column preference.
    - Changed conditionals in frame/3/*/*_front.c that induce transposition
      of the operation so that the transposition is induced only if there
      is disagreement between the storage of C and the preference of the
      micro-kernel. Previously, the only conditional that needed to be met
      was that C was row-stored, which is to say that we assumed the micro-
      kernel preferred column-contiguous access on C.
    - Added a "prefers_contig_rows" property to func_t objects, and updated
      calls to bli_func_obj_create() in _cntl.c files in order to support
      the above changes.
    - Removed the row-storage optimization from bli_trsm_front.c because
      it is actually ineffective. This is because the right-side case of
      trsm flips the A and B micro-panel operands (since BLIS only requires
      left-side gemmtrsm/trsm kernels), meaning any transposition done
      at the high level is then undone at the low level.
    - Tweaked trmm, trmm3 _front.c files to eliminate a possible redundant
      invocation of the bli_obj_swap() macro.

    Reorganized packm ukernels.
    
    Details:
    - Previously, packm micro-kernels were organized by the implied register
      blocksize (panel dimension) assumed by the kernel, meaning conventional,
      ri, and ri3 variations of some micro-kernel size were housed in the same
      file. This commit reorganizes the micro-kernels so that all sizes reside
      in the same file for each format type (conventional, ri, and ri3).

    Tweaks to gemm4m, gemm3m virtual ukernels.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a potential, but as-yet unobserved bug in gemm3m that would
      allow undesirable inf/NaN propogation, since C was being scaled by
      beta even if it was equal to zero.
    - In gemm3m micro-kernel, we now avoid copying C to the temporary
      micro-tile if beta is zero.
    - Rearranged computation in gemm4m so that the temporary C micro-tile
      is accessed less, and C is accessed only after the micro-kernel
      calls. This improves performance marginally in most situations.
    - Comment updates to both gemm4m and gemm3m micro-kernels.

    Reverted _obj_is_[row|col]_stored() macros.
    
    Details:
    - Rolled back recent changes to bli_obj_is_row_stored() and
      bli_obj_is_col_stored() so that those macros now only inspect the
      strides (row or column). It turns out that the more sophisticated
      definitions introduced in a51e32e are not necessary, because these
      "obj" macros are virtually never used on packed matrices, and when
      they are, they can use bli_obj_is_[row|col}_packed() macros, which
      inspect the info bitfield.

    Added CBLAS compatibility layer.
    
    Details:
    - Added a new section in bli_config.h files of all configurations for
      enabling CBLAS support. (Currently, the default is for the CBLAS layer
      to be disabled.)
    - Added a directory, frame/compat/cblas, to house CBLAS source code. A
      subdirectory 'f77_sub' holds subroutine wrappers corresponding to
      subroutines found in CBLAS that allow calling some BLAS routines with
      the return value passed as the last argument rather than as an actual
      (function) return value. This was probably intended to allow CBLAS to
      avoid the whole f2c debacle altogether. However, since BLIS does not
      assume the presence of a Fortran compiler, we had to provide similar
      routines in C.
    - A script, integrate-cblas-tarball.sh, is included to streamline the
      integration of future revisions of the CBLAS source code.
    - The current tarball, cblas.tgz, that was used with the above script to
      generate the present set of CBLAS source code is also included.
    - Updated blis.h to include necessary CBLAS-related headers.

    Fix permissions error installing to non-owned directory

commit db97ce979b88c051922c2f946ce52d523c7a12c6
Author: Kevin Locke <kevin@kevinlocke.name>
Date:   Sun Aug 3 12:48:04 2014 -0600

    Fix permissions error installing to non-owned directory
    
    When installing to a directory which is not owned by the installing
    user, even when the user has write permission for the directory, the
    installation can fail with an error similar to the following:
    
    Installing libblis-0.1.4-7-sandybridge.a into /usr/local/lib/
    install: cannot change permissions of ‘/usr/local/lib’: Operation not permitted
    Makefile:658: recipe for target '/usr/local/lib/libblis-0.1.4-7-sandybridge.a' failed
    make: *** [/usr/local/lib/libblis-0.1.4-7-sandybridge.a] Error 1
    
    In the example case, the error occurred because the user attempted to
    install to /usr/local and /usr/local/lib is owned by root with mode 2755
    which the Makefile unsuccessfully attempted to change to 0755.
    
    Given that installing to /usr/local is likely to be quite common and the
    ownership/permissions are the default for Debian and Debian-derived
    Linux distributions (perhaps others as well), this commit attempts to
    support that use case by using mkdir rather than install to create the
    directory (which is the same approach as Automake).

    Details:
    - Redefined many of the macros that define bit fields and bit values in
      the obj_t info field using the bitshift operator (<<). This makes it
      easier to reorder bit fields, or expand existing bit fields, or add
      new fields. The bitshifting should be evaluated by the compiler at
      compile-time.

    Reimplemented unit blocksize fix in prev commit.
    
    Details:
    - Instead of inferring the storage format of the micro-panels from within
      the packm variants, we now pass in a bool_t value that denotes whether
      the packed matrix contains row-stored column panels or column-stored
      row panels. This value can then be tested more easily inside the main
      packm variant loop.
    - Renumbered pack_t schema values in bli_type_defs.h so that there are
      now five bits, each with different meaning:
      - 4: packed or not packed?
      - 3: packed for 3m?
      - 2: packed for 4m?
      - 1: packed to panels?
      - 0: stored by rows or columns?
    - Added new macros that test for status of above bits in schema bit
      subfield, and renamed some existing macros related to 4m/3m.

    Fixed unit register blocksize brokenness.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a breakdown in BLIS's ability to differentiate between row-stored
      and column-stored micro-panels when MR or NR is unit. When either
      register blocksize (or both) is equal to one, inspecting the strides of
      the affected packed micro-panel is no longer sufficient to determine
      whether the micro-panel is a row-stored column panel or a column-stored
      row panel (because both strides are unit). At that point, dimension
      information is necessary when invoking the bli_is_row_stored_f() and
      bli_is_col_stored_f() macros (and their "obj" counterparts). Thanks to
      Ilya Polkovnichenko for reporting this bug.
    - Added panel dimensions (m and n) to obj_t, which are set in
      packm_init() and then passed into the blocked variants to support the
      aforementioned update.

    Tweaked behavior of herk, her2k for BLAS compat.
    
    Details:
    - Updated herk_front() and her2k_front() to explicitly set the imaginary
      components of the diagonal entries of C to zero after the computation
      is complete. This is needed in case downstream applications read the
      full diagonal entries (i.e., including imaginary part), which could, in
      the absence of this modification, accumulate numerical error from
      subsequent rank-k/rank-2k updates.
    - Updated BLAS compatibility wrappers for herk and her2k to return early
      if:
        n == 0 || ( ( alpha == 0 || k == 0 ) && beta == 1 )
      This also results in the imaginary components of diagonal entries NOT
      being set to zero (see above), which is consistent with BLAS.
    - Updated mkherm to use setid instead of an inlined loop over the
      diagonal.

    Details:
    - Defined a new level-1d operation, setid, which sets the imaginary
      elements of an object's diagonal to a single scalar. This can be
      useful, for example, when trying to make the diagonal of a Hermitian
      matrix real-valued.

    Changed order of zero dim / error checking.
    
    Details:
    - Updated level-2 and level-3 internal back-ends so that the operation's
      _check() function is called BEFORE any attempt to return early due to
      the presence of zero dimensions. This ordering makes more sense because
      (for example) object dimensions should match even if one of them is
      zero. Previously, a dimension mismatch could result in an early return
      with no error message.
    - Updated bli_check_object_buffer() so that NULL buffers result in an
      error only if the object is dimensionally non-empty (i.e., only if both
      of the object's dimensions are non-zero). This allows BLIS operations
      to be performed on dimensionally empty objects (i.e., where at least one
      dimension is zero).
    - Updated the error message associated with bli_check_object_buffer()
      to mention the newly relaxed constraint mentioned above, vis-a-vis
      non-zero dimensions.

    Inserted gemv beta-scaling bug into compat layer.
    
    Details:
    - BLAS has a peculiar bug (or feature) whereby calling gemv on a vector
      y of non-zero length and a vector x of zero length results in no action.
      Given that the operation is y := beta*y + A*x, many (most?) individuals
      would expect vector y to still be scaled by beta. BLIS, when called
      natively, handles these cases intuitively (with beta scaling).
      Unfortunately, many BLAS test suites actually check for the way this
      situation is handled. Therefore, we have decided to implement this "bug"
      in the compatibility layer so as to provide "bug-for-bug" compatibility
      with BLAS.

    Details:
    - Minor updates to comments and formatting in bump-version.sh and
      update-version-file.sh scripts.

    Added bli_info_*() query functions.
    
    Details:
    - Added a new API family, bli_info_*(), which can be used to query
      information about how BLIS was configured. Most of these values are
      returned as gint_t, with the exception of the version string which
      is char*.
    - Changed how the testsuite driver queries information about how BLIS
      was configured (from using macro constants directly to using the
      new bli_info API).
    - Removed bli_version.c and its header file.
    - Added STRINGIFY_INT() macro to bli_macro_defs.h
    - Renamed info_t type in bli_type_defs.h to objbits_t (not because of
      an actual naming conflict, but because the name 'info_t' would now be
      somewhat misleading in the presence of the new bli_info API, as the
      two are unrelated).

    Minor bugfixes to BLAS compatibility layer.
    
    Details:
    - Changed bla_amax.c so that i?amax() routines now correctly return 0
      if ( n < 1 || incx <= 0 ).
    - Changed bla_rotg.c and bla_rotmg.c to use bli_fabs() macro instead of
      f2c's abs() macro for float and double cases.
    - Thanks to Murtaza Ali for suggesting the two fixes above.
    - Updated label of fnormv to normfv in testsuite/input.operations.

    Fixed possible level-3 inf/NaN issue when beta=0.
    
    Details:
    - Redefined xpbys_mxn and xpbys_mxn_u/_l macros to employ a copy
      (instead of scaling by beta) when beta is zero. This will stamp out
      any possible infs or NaNs in the output matrix, if it happens to be
      uninitialized. Thanks to Tony Kelman for isolating this bug.

    Defined _ukernel_void() wrappers to micro-kernels.
    
    Details:
    - Added wrappers for micro-kernels so that users may invoke the
      micro-kernels without knowing what the function names actually are.
      This is useful when an application wishes to call the micro-kernel
      from a shared library instance of BLIS, where the application may not
      necessarily have the luxury of grabbing the micro-kernel name(s) from
      C preprocessor macros at compile-time. Also, since the wrappers use
      void* pointers, one's environment does not need to be aware of some
      BLIS types such as scomplex and dcomplex. These wrappers now join the
      level-1 and level-1f kernel wrappers, which pre-dated this commit.
    - Removed the wrapper definitions and prototypes from the micro-kernel
      test suite modules, and replaced calls to them with calls to the new
      wrappers mentioned above.

    Quick and dirty multithreading for TRSM
    
    Should work fine for small number of threads (up to 8 or maybe even 16).
    However, performance is yet untested.
    This parallelizes the "JR" loop for the left sided cases
    and the "IR" loop for the right sided cases.
    
    Future work is to parallelize the outer loops as well.

    Added shared library support to build system.
    
    Details:
    - Modified top-level Makefile to support building shared (dynamic)
      libraries.
    - Updated most configurations' make_defs.mk files to include necessary
      compiler/linker flags needed by top-level Makefile.
    - Note that by default, all configurations presently do NOT build
      shared libraries. To enable, one must change the value of
      BLIS_ENABLE_DYNAMIC_BUILD to 'yes'.

    Fixed ldim alignment bug in core2 gemm ukernel.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in the dunnington/core2 gemm micro-kernels that resulted in
      a segmentation fault if a column-stored matrix's starting address was
      aligned, but its leading dimension was such that its second column was
      unaligned. Basically, the micro-kernel was assuming that aligned load
      instructions were safe when they actually were not. An extra condition
      that checks the alignment of cs_c (ie: the leading dimension in the
      column storage case) has now been added. Thanks to Michael Lehn for
      reporting this bug.

    Changed treatment of NULL object buffers.
    
    Details:
    - Relaxed the constraint in bli_obj_attach_buffer_check(), which required
      the buffer address being attached to be non-NULL. This is acceptable
      because the user was already able to create and use objects with NULL
      buffers (via bli_obj_create_without_buffer(), which initializes the
      buffer to NULL).
    - Inserted calls to newly defined function, bli_check_object_buffer(),
      into nearly all operations' _check() or _int_check() functions. This
      allows BLIS to abort peacefully if a computational routine is called
      with an object containing a NULL buffer. By contrast, under such
      conditions, BLAS would typically fail with a segmentation fault.
    - Within operation front-ends, moved the calls to _check()/_int_check()
      so that zero dimensions are checked first (and if found, execution
      returns with trivial or no computation). This resolves issue #7. Thanks
      to Jack Poulson for reporting this bug.

    Can now query register blocksizes from blk algs.
    
    Details:
    - Added a new field to blksz_t objects that allows one to attach a
      sub-object. Doing this allows us to associate a register blocksize with
      any given cache blocksize. That way, the register blocksize can be
      queried wherever the cache blocksize would normally be accessible
      (e.g. a blocked algorithm).
    - Modified bli_gemm_cntl.c (and 4m/3m variants) so that the register
      blocksizes are attached to the cache blocksizes after they are created.

      4m/3m variants).

    Now there is an implicit barrier inside unpackm that only occurs if C is packed (which is usually not the case)
    
    Moved the enabling of the tree barriers into bli_config.h
    Fed the default MR and NR for double precision into bli_get_range instead of the number 8

    Details:
    - Fixed improper usage of restrict keyword in axpyv and dotv bgq kernels.
      (However, there may be other instances of similar misuse elsewhere in
      BLIS.) Thanks to Jeff Hammond for reporting this issue.

    Made barrier after packing implicit.
    
    This also fixed a bug where barriers in the blocked variants were inserted after the inner packing routines,
    but not the outer packing routines.
    This allowed, for instance, the block of B to not be finished being packed before computation to occur.

    Refined INSERT_GENTFUNC macro usage.
    
    Details:
    - Defined new INSERT_GENTFUNC macros so that the macro always takes
      exactly the number of arguments needed for the particular operation or
      variant being defined. Many operations were using INSERT_GENTFUNC
      macros that expected one auxiliary argument even though none were
      needed. Those instances have now been updated. Most of these instances
      were in the level-0 and -1v operations, as well as some operations
      defined in frame/util.

    Minor simplifications to trmm, trsm macro-kernels.
    
    Details:
    - Simplified some code that would have allowed the diagonal of a trmm
      or trsm triangular matrix to intersect the short end of a micro-panel.
      This is disallowed via higher-level constraints on cache blocksizes, so
      this code was never needed and only served to obfuscate.
    - Updated some comments in trmm, trsm macro-kernels.

    Reorganized norm operations.
    
    Details:
    - Completely reoganized norm operations:
      - Renames:
        - fnormsc, fnormv, fnormm -> normfsc, normfv, normfm (2-norm)
        - absumv -> norm1v (vector 1-norm)
      - New operations:
        - norm1m (matrix 1-norm)
        - normiv, normim (infinity-norm)
        - amaxv (BLAS-like absolute maximum value index)
        - asumv (BLAS-like absolute sum)
    - Deprecated absumm, as it did not correspond to any actual norm.
      (However, an inlined version now exists in the testsuite module for
      randm.)

    Switched to using environment variables to control threading.
    
    The environment variables all follow the format BLIS_X_NT,
    where X is the index of the loop as described in our paper
    Anatomy of High Performance Many-Threaded Matrix Multiplication.
    These indices are IR, JR, IC, KC, and JC.
    
    Also enabled parallelism for hemm and symm, but these are currently untested.

    Minor fixes to sumsqv, abmaxv.
    
    Details:
    - Minor update to bli_sumsqv_unb_var1() to bring it up-to-date with
      LAPACK 3.5.0's zlassq.f, which, starting with 3.4.2, returns NaN when
      the vector (or matrix) contains a NaN.
    - Minor change to bli_abmaxv_unb_var1() to more closely mimic the
      behavior of netlib BLAS's izamax(). There, a "less than or equal to"
      operator is used in the search instead of "less than", which would
      change the element index returned if there were multiple maximum values.
    - Added macro function definitions for bli_isinf() and bli_isnan(), which
      are currently implemented in terms of isinf() and isnan() from math.h.

    Fixed various bugs when C99 complex is enabled.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed various bugs in packm_*_cxk(), the 4m/3m micro-kernels, and
      elsewhere in the framework that were not yet set up to work properly
      when BLIS_ENABLE_C99_COMPLEX is defined in bli_config.h
    - Extensive changes to f2c-derived files in frame/compat/f2c to allow
      C99 complex storage. Most of these changes center around accessing
      real and imaginary components via bli_?real()/bli_?imag() accessor
      macros, and setting of values via bli_?sets() assignment macros.
      (Thanks to Vladimir Sukarev for pointing out that _ENABLE_C99_COMPLEX
      was broken.)

    In packm variant 1, the variable p_begin was incremented each iteration, causing a dependency.
    This dependeny was removed, allowing each iteration to be executed in parallel.
    
    Somewhere in bli_threading.c, I was allocating an array of pointers instead of an array of structs.

    - Removed BLIS_CONTIG_STRIDE_ALIGN_SIZE from bli_config.h of all
      configurations. It was already going unused in packm_init() since the
      recent 4m/3m commit. This setting was rarely, if ever, useful, and its
      existence only posed a potential risk for 4m/3m-based implementations.
    - Removed BLIS_CONTIG_STRIDE_ALIGN_SIZE usage from mem_pool_macro_defs.h.
    - Updated comments regarding CONTIG_STRIDE_ALIGN_SIZE in template
      micro-kernels.

    CHANGELOG update (for 0.1.1).

commit fde5f1fdece19881f50b142e8611b772a647e6d2 (tag: 0.1.1)
Author: Field G. Van Zee <field@cs.utexas.edu>
Date:   Tue Feb 25 13:34:56 2014 -0600

    Added extensive support for configuration defaults.
    
    Details:
    - Standard names for reference kernels (levels-1v, -1f and 3) are now
      macro constants. Examples:
        BLIS_SAXPYV_KERNEL_REF
        BLIS_DDOTXF_KERNEL_REF
        BLIS_ZGEMM_UKERNEL_REF
    - Developers no longer have to name all datatype instances of a kernel
      with a common base name; [sdcz] datatype flavors of each kernel or
      micro-kernel (level-1v, -1f, or 3) may now be named independently.
      This means you can now, if you wish, encode the datatype-specific
      register blocksizes in the name of the micro-kernel functions.
    - Any datatype instances of any kernel (1v, 1f, or 3) that is left
      undefined in bli_kernel.h will default to the corresponding reference
      implementation. For example, if BLIS_DGEMM_UKERNEL is left undefined,
      it will be defined to be BLIS_DGEMM_UKERNEL_REF.
    - Developers no longer need to name level-1v/-1f kernels with multiple
      datatype chars to match the number of types the kernel WOULD take in
      a mixed type environment, as in bli_dddaxpyv_opt(). Now, one char is
      sufficient, as in bli_daxpyv_opt().
    - There is no longer a need to define an obj_t wrapper to go along with
      your level-1v/-1f kernels. The framework now prvides a _kernel()
      function which serves as the obj_t wrapper for whatever kernels are
      specified (or defaulted to) via bli_kernel.h
    - Developers no longer need to prototype their kernels, and thus no
      longer need to include any prototyping headers from within
      bli_kernel.h. The framework now generates kernel prototypes, with the
      proper type signature, based on the kernel names defined (or defaulted
      to) via bli_kernel.h.
    - If the complex datatype x (of [cz]) implementation of the gemm micro-
      kernel is left undefined by bli_kernel.h, but its same-precision real
      domain equivalent IS defined, BLIS will use a 4m-based implementation
      for the datatype x implementations of all level-3 operations, using
      only the real gemm micro-kernel.

    Added level-3 support for complex via 4m-/3m.
    
    Details:
    - Added the ability to induce complex domain level-3 operations via new
      virtual complex micro-kernels which are implemented via only real
      domain micro-kernels. Two new implementations are provided: 4m and 3m.
      4m implements complex matrix multiplication in terms of four real
      matrix multiplications, where as 3m uses only three and thus is
      capable of even higher (than peak) performance. However, the 3m method
      has somewhat weaker numerical properties, making it less desirable
      in general.
    - Further refined packing routines, which were recently revamped, and
      added packing functionality for 4m and 3m.
    - Some modifications to trmm and trsm macro-kernels to facilitate indexing
      into micro-panels which were packed for 4m/3m virtual kernels.
    - Added 4m and 3m interfaces for each level-3 operation.
    - Various other minor changes to facilitate 4m/3m methods.

    Minor fixes to trsm consistent with prev on trmm.
    
    Details:
    - Removed use of bli_min() and bli_max() that were only being used to
      try to support situations where the diagonal would intersect the
      short end of some micro-panels, which is situation that is disallowed
      at a higher level by various constraints on the register and cache
      blocksize. This only affected trsm_ll and trsm_lu.
    - Use panel stride as passed into the macro-kernel rather than compute
      it via k and PACKMR/PACKNR. This affects all macro-kernels of trsm.

    Details:
    - Fixed an obscure bug in left-hand trmm that would only manifest when
      non-zero register blocksize extensions (PACKMR > MR or PACKNR > NR)
      are used.

    Fixed an obscure bug in packm_cxk().
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in packm_cxk() whereby the packm ukernel was being chosen
      from ldp, which is always equal to PACKMR or PACKNR. The problem with
      this is that the pack ukernels were implicitly assuming that the
      panel dimension of the panel being packed was equal to ldp, which
      is not the case when the register blocksizes extensions are non-zero
      (ie: when PACKMR > MR or PACKNR > NR, whichever is applicable). This
      problem has been fixed by passing ldp into the pack ukernels, which
      now walk through the packed micro-panel region by incrementing by this
      value, rather than incrementing by the inherent panel dimension value
      assumed by each packm ukernel (e.g. 4 in the case of packm_ref_4xk).
    - Also fixed a very minor edge case inefficiency whereby pack ukernels
      smaller than the default were not being used in edge cases, and instead
      those situations were being handled by scal2m. This is related to the
      issue above, because the pack ukernel itself was being chosen based on
      ldp instead of the panel dimension.

    Details:
    - Consolidated the functionality previously supported by packm_blk_var2()
      and packm_blk_var3() into a new variant, packm_blk_var1().
    - Updates to packm_gen_cxk(), packm_herm_cxk.c(), and packm_tri_cxk()
      to accommodate above changes.
    - Removed packm_blk_var3() and retired packm_blk_var2() to
      frame/1m/packm/old.
    - Updated all level-3 _cntl_init() functions so that the new, more
      versatile packm_blk_var1 is used for all level-3 matrix packing.

      separate functions: packm_gen_cxk(), packm_herm_cxk(), and
      packm_tri_cxk(), respectively. Also, homogenized the packm code as
      well as the new specialized packm_*_cxk() code to further improve
      readability.

    Details:
    - Defined a new macro, INSERT_GENTFUNC_BASIC0, which takes only one
      argument--the base name of the function--and employed this macro
      in the reference micro-kernel files instead of the _BASIC macro,
      which takes one auxiliary argument. That argument was not being
      used and probably just acted to unnecessarily obfuscate.

    Details:
    - Updated (and fixed some errors in) the "Assumptions/assertions" comment
      section of macro-kernels.
    - Changed register blocksizes of reference configuration to MR = 8 and
      NR = 4. It's always good for MR != NR in the reference configuration
      since it may help uncover bugs related to non-square micro-kernels.

    Pass panel dimensions into macro-kernels.
    
    Details:
    - Modified the interfaces to the datatype-specific macro-kernels so that:
      - pd_a and pd_b are passed in (which contain the panel dimensions of
        packed panels of a and b).
      - rs_a and cs_b are no longer passed in (they were guaranteed to be 1).
    - Modified implementations of datatype-specific macro-kernels so pd_a,
      pd_b, cs_a, and rs_b are used instead of cpp macros for MR, NR, PACKMR,
      and PACKNR, respectively.
    - Declare temporary c matrices (ct) as being maxmr-by-maxnr, which for now
      is equivalent to being mr-by-nr. maxmr and maxnr are declared in a new
      header file bli_kernel_post_macro_defs.h.

    Added early returns for "object is zeros" case.
    
    Details:
    - Added some logic to packm_init(), pack_int() and gemm_int() so that
      (a) objects marked as BLIS_ZEROS are not packed, and (b) those
      objects are not computed with. This functionality is not currently
      needed by any existing implementations, but may be used in the
      future.

      partitioning in the "forward" direction.

    Removed redundant non-gemm blksz_t creation.
    
    Details:
    - Removed code that creates duplicate blksz_t objects for herk, trmm,
      and trsm. Instead, the gemm blksz_t objects are accessed via extern
      and used directly. This reduces the amount of code associated with
      each of the three _cntl_init() and _cntl_finalize() function.

    Introduced new level-3 front-end layer.
    
    Details:
    - Added new _front() functions for each level-3 operation. This is done
      so that the choosing of the control tree (and *only* the choosing of
      the control tree) happens in what was previously the "front end"
      (e.g. bli_gemm()). That control tree is then passed into the _front()
      function, which then performs up-front tasks such as parameter
      checking.

    Removed redundant hemm, her2k control trees.
    
    Details:
    - Removed code that generated a control tree specifically for hemm and
      symm. Instead, the gemm control tree is now configured so that it
      works for gemm, hemm, or symm.
    - Retired most her2k code, as it was not being used. (Currently, her2k is
      implemented as two invocations of herk.) I couldn't think of many
      situations where her2k variants were needed.
    - Removed some older her2k code.

    Embed func_t microkernel objects in control trees.
    
    Details:
    - Modified all control tree node definitions to include a new field of
      type func_t*, which is similar to a blksz_t except that it contains
      one function pointer (each typed simply as void*) for each datatype.
      We use the func_t* to embed pointers to the micro-kernels to use for
      the leaf-level nodes of each control tree. This change is a natural
      extension of control trees and will allow more flexibility in the
      future.
    - Modified all macro-kernel wrappers to obtain the micro-kernel pointers
      from the incomming (previously ignored) control tree node and then pass
      the queried pointer into the datatype-specific macro-kernel code, which
      then casts the pointer to the appropriate type (new typedefs residing
      in bli_kernel_type_defs.h) and then uses the pointer to call the micro-
      kernel. Thus, the micro-kernel function is no longer "hard-coded" (that
      is, determined when the datatype-specific macro-kernel functions are
      instantiated by the C preprocessor).
    - Added macros to bli_kernel_macro_defs.h that build datatype-specific
      base names if they do not exist already, and then uses those to build
      datatype-specific micro-kernel function names. This will allow
      developers extra flexibility if they wanted to, for example, name each
      of their datatype-specific micro-kernels differently (e.g. double
      real might be named bli_dgemm_opt_4x4() while double complex might be
      named bli_zgemm_opt_2x2()).
    - Inserted appropriate code into _cntl_init() functions that allocates
      and initializes a func_t object for the corresponding micro-kernels.
      The gemm ukernel func_t object is created once, in bli_gemm_cntl_init(),
      and then reused via extern wherever possible.

    Details:
    - Removed commented-out code from macro-kernels that was supposed to
      facilitate implementing mixed domain (complex times real) matrix
      multiplication. This functionality is still (probably possible),
      but I'm getting tired of looking at the code every time I edit
      a macro-kernel. Plus, there are probably ways of doing it at a
      higher level, via control trees.

    Removed b_aux field from cntl nodes.
    
    Details:
    - Removed b_aux field from all control tree node definitions. This field
      was being used in certain optimizations (incremental blocking) that were
      not actually being employed within BLIS, and are probably not employed
      by others.
    - Updated all _cntl_obj_create() function definitions and invocations
      according to above change.
    - Retired bli_gemm_blk_var4.c, which was one such function that employed
      incremental blocking, but which was never called by BLIS itself.

    Consolidated pack_t enums; retired VECTOR value.
    
    Details:
    - Changed the pack_t enumerations so that BLIS_PACKED_VECTOR no longer has
      its own value, and instead simply aliases to BLIS_PACKED_UNSPEC. This
      makes room in the three pack_t bits of the info field of obj_t so that
      two values are now unused, and may be used for other future purposes.
    - Updated sloppy terminology usage in comments in level-2 front-ends.
      (Replaced "is contiguous" with more accurate "has unit stride".)

    Details:
    - Redirect errors to /dev/null when using 'find' to locate libraries that
      would be uninstalled upon executing "make uninstall-old". Before, if the
      Makefile was read before $(INSTALL_PREFIX)/lib existed, a "No such file
      or directory" message was emitted. This message was harmless, but is now
      suppressed in this situation.

    Typecast bli_getopt() return value in testsuite.
    
    Details:
    - In the test suite driver, inserted an explicit typecast of the return
      value of bli_getopt() prior parsing. The lack of typecast caused a
      problem on at least one system whereby a return value of -1 was
      interpreted as garbage character. Thanks to Francisco Igual for finding
      and submitting this fix.

    Allow building outside source distribution.
    
    Details:
    - Modified build system (mostly configure and top-level Makefile) so that
      a user can build a BLIS library outside of the top-level directory of
      the source distribution.
    - Added "test" target to Makefile so that the user can run "make test",
      which will compile, link, and run the testsuite binary. This works even
      if the build directory is externally located, thanks to the test suite
      binary's new -g and -o command-line options. Also, when creating the
      test suite via the top-level Makefile, the linking is against the
      local archive, in lib/<configname>, rather than at <install_prefix>/lib.
    - Modified testsuite/Makefile so that it links against the library built
      locally, in ../lib/<configname>.
    - Added "-lm" to LDFLAGS of most configurations' make_defs.mk.
    - Various other cleanups to build system.

      a custom version of getopt(), which may be used to parse command line
      options passed into a program via argc/argv. I am implementing this
      function myself, as opposed to using the version available via unistd.h,
      for portability reasons, as the only requirements are string.h (which
      is available via the standard C library).
    - Modified test suite to allow the user to specify the file name (and/or
      path) to the parameters and operations input files: -g may be used to
      specify the general input file and -o to specify the operations input
      file). If -g or -o or both are not given, default filenames are assumed
      (as well as their existence in the current directory).

    Updated template micro-kernels to use auxinfo_t.
    
    Details:
    - Updated template micro-kernel implementations (located in
      config/template/kernels), to adhere to the new auxinfo_t interface.
      Meant to include this change in a0331fb1.
    - Changed template configuration to use 64-bit integers (for both BLIS
      and the BLAS compatibility layer).

    Removed error checks in netlib->BLIS param mapping
    
    Details:
    - Disabled error checking in netlib-to-BLIS parameter mapping functions.
      If the char value input to these functions was not one of the defined
      values, bli_check_error_code() with the appropriate error code value
      would be called, resulting in an abort(). This was unnecessary and
      redundant since these routines are currently only used within the
      BLAS compatibility layer, and they are only called AFTER parameter
      checking has already been performed on the original BLAS char values.
      If the application tried to override xerbla() to prevent an abort()
      from being called, this error checking would still get in the way.
      Thus, instead of reporting the error situation to the framework (ie:
      calling abort()), an arbitrary BLIS parameter value is now chosen and
      the function returns normally. Thanks to Jeff Hammond for finding and
      reporting this issue.

    Store variable panel strides in trmm/trsm auxinfo.
    
    Details:
    - Changed the value being stored into the auxinfo_t structure in trmm
      and trsm macro-kernels. Whereas before we stored whatever value was
      provided to the macro-kernel implementation via ps_a/ps_b, now we
      store the stride that will advance to the next variable-length
      micro-panel of the triangular matrix A (left) or B (right).
    - Whitespace changes to the files affected above.

      invocation, bli_is_last_iter(), that tests the same condition.
    - Updated gemm_ukr module to use auxinfo_t argument.

    Introduced auxinfo_t argument to micro-kernels.
    
    Details:
    - Removed a_next and b_next arguments to micro-kernels and replaced them
      with a pointer to a new datatype, auxinfo_t, which is simply a struct
      that holds a_next and b_next. The struct may hold other auxiliary
      information that may be useful to a micro-kernel, such as micro-panel
      stride. Micro-kernels may access struct fields via accessor macros
      defined in bli_auxinfo_macro_defs.h.
    - Updated all instances of micro-kernel definitions, micro-kernel calls,
      as well as macro-kernels (for declaring and initializing the structs)
      according to above change.

    - Added set of basic scalar macros that take arguments' real and
      imaginary components separately, named like the previous set except
      with the "ris" (instead of "s") suffix.
    - Redefined the previous set of scalar macros (those that take arguments
      "whole") in terms of the new "ri" set.
    - Renamed setris and getris macros to sets and gets.
    - Renamed setimag0 macros to seti0s.
    - Use bli_?1 macro instead of a local constant in bla_trmv.c, bla_trsv.c.

    Added new "attached" scalar representation.
    
    Details:
    - Added infrastructure to support a new scalar representation, whereby
      every object contains an internal scalar that defaults to 1.0. This
      facilitates passing scalars around without having to house them in
      separate objects. These "attached" scalars are stored in the internal
      atom_t field of the obj_t struct, and are always stored to be the same
      datatype as the object to which they are attached. Level-3 variants no
      longer take scalar arguments, however, level-3 internal back-ends stll
      do; this is so that the calling function can perform subproblems such
      as C := C - alpha * A * B on-the-fly without needing to change either
      of the scalars attached to A or B.
    - Removed scalar argument from packm_int().
    - Observe and apply attached scalars in scalm_int(), and removed scalar
      from interface of scalm_unb_var1().
    - Renamed the following functions (and corresponding invocations):
    
       bli_obj_init_scalar_copy_of()
                               -> bli_obj_scalar_init_detached_copy_of()
       bli_obj_init_scalar()   -> bli_obj_scalar_init_detached()
       bli_obj_create_scalar_with_attached_buffer()
                               -> bli_obj_create_1x1_with_attached_buffer()
       bli_obj_scalar_equals() -> bli_obj_equals()
    
    - Defined new functions:
    
       bli_obj_scalar_detach()
       bli_obj_scalar_attach()
       bli_obj_scalar_apply_scalar()
       bli_obj_scalar_reset()
       bli_obj_scalar_has_nonzero_imag()
       bli_obj_scalar_equals()
    
    - Placed all bli_obj_scalar_* functions in a new file, bli_obj_scalar.c.
    - Renamed the following macros:
    
       bli_obj_scalar_buffer() -> bli_obj_buffer_for_1x1()
       bli_obj_is_scalar()     -> bli_obj_is_1x1()
    
    - Defined new macros to set and copy internal scalars between objects:
    
       bli_obj_set_internal_scalar()
       bli_obj_copy_internal_scalar()
    
    - In level-3 internal back-ends, added conditional blocks where alpha and
      beta are checked for non-unit-ness. Those values for alpha and beta are
      applied to the scalars attached to aliases of A/B/C, as appropriate,
      before being passed into the variant specified by the control tree.
    - In level-3 blocked variants, pass BLIS_ONE into subproblems instead of
      alpha and/or beta.
    - In level-3 macro-kernels, changed how scalars are obtained. Now, scalars
      attached to A and B are multiplied together to obtain alpha, while beta
      is obtained directly from C.
    - In level-3 front-ends, removed old function calls meant to provide
      future support for mixed domain/precision. These can be added back later
      once that functionality is given proper treatment. Also, removed the
      creating of copy-casts of alpha and beta since typecasting of scalars
      is now implicitly handled in the internal back-ends when alpha and
      beta are applied to the attached scalars.

    Removed optional scaling from packm control tree.
    
    Details:
    - Removed does_scale field from packm control tree node and
      bli_packm_cntl_obj_create() interface. Adjusted all invocations of
      _cntl_obj_create() accordingly.
    - Redefined/renamted macros that are used in aliasing so that now,
      bli_obj_alias_to() does a full alias (shallow copy) while
      bli_obj_alias_for_packing() does a partial alias that preserves the
      pack_mem-related fields of the aliasing (destination) object.
    - Removed bli_trmm3_cntl.c, .h after realizing that the trmm control tree
      will work just fine for bli_trmm3().
    - Removed some commented vestiges of the typecasting functionality needed
      to support heterogeneous datatypes.

      most kernel sets, such as those in the template set, do not have object
      wrappers.

    Changed dim_t and inc_t to be signed integers.
    
    Details:
    - Redefined dim_t and inc_t in terms of gint_t (instead of guint_t).
      This will facilitate interoperability with Fortran in the future.
      (Fortran does not support unsigned integers.)
    - Redefined many instances of stride-related macros so that they return
      or use the absolute value of the strides, rather than the raw strides
      which may now be signed. Added new macros bli_is_row_stored_f() and
      bli_is_col_stored_f(), which assume positive (forward-oriented) strides,
      and changed the packm_blk_var[23] variants to use these macros instead
      of the existing bli_is_row_stored(), bli_is_col_stored().
    - Added/adjusted typecasting to to various functions/macros, including
      bli_obj_alloc_buffer(), bli_obj_buffer_at_off(), and various pointer-
      related macros in bli_param_macro_defs.h.
    - Redefined bli_convert_blas_incv() macro so that the BLAS compatibility
      layer properly handles situations where vector increments are negative.
      Thanks to Vladimir Sukharev for pointing out this issue.
    - Changed type of increment parameters in bli_adjust_strides() from dim_t
      to inc_t. Likewise in bli_check_matrix_strides().
    - Defined bli_check_matrix_object(), which checks for negative strides.
    - Redefined bli_check_scalar_object() and bli_check_vector_object() so
      that they also check for negative stride.
    - Added instances of bli_check_matrix_object() to various operations'
      _check routines.

    Fixed bugs in scalv and setv.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed bugs similar to those addressed in cca1e1f51dc6, whereby
      a segmentation fault may occur if beta is not the same type as
      the vector operand for scalv and setv.
    - Changed axpyv and scal2v front-ends in a similar fashion.

    Fixed a bug related to Hermitian matrix diagonals.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug whereby BLIS assumed that the imaginary components of the
      diagonal elements of Hermitian matrices were already zero. This property
      is now enforced when the matrix is packed (bli_packm_blk_var2). Thanks
      to Vladimir Sukharev for reporting this bug.
    - Minor comment updates to template kernels.

    Added scaling to abval2s, sqrt2s macros.
    
    Details:
    - Re-defined abval2s and sqrt2s macros to use scaling to avoid underflow
      and overflow from squaring the real and imaginary components. (This is
      the same technique used to fix recent bugs in invscals/invscaljs and
      inverts.)

    Fixed bug in complex invscals.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed complex inversion in invscals and invscaljs whereby the
      imaginary component was being computed incorrectly.
    - Use bli_fmaxabs() instead of bli_fabs() when choosing the scalar
      in inverts, invscals, and invscaljs.
    - Changed bli_abs() and bli_fabs() macro definitions to use "<="
      operator instead of "<".

    Fixed bugs in scalm and setm.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed bugs in scalm and setm that resulted in segmentation faults when
      beta is not the same type as the matrix operand. Thanks to Vladimir
      Sukharev for reporting this bug.
    - Changed axpym and scal2m front-ends in fashion similar to that of scalm
      and setm; namely, the alpha scalar is copy-cast the type of the first
      matrix operand.
    - Changed the template and reference configurations' bli_config.h files
      so that the number of memory allocator blocks of A and B are set based
      on BLIS_MAX_NUM_THREADS.
    - Comment updates to bli_obj.c and variable rename in bla_nrm2.c.

    - Fixed the complex bli_?inverts() macros, which were inverting elements
      in an "unsafe" manner, such that very large and very small values were
      unnecessarily over/under-flowing. Thanks for Vladimir Sukharev for
      reporting this bug.
    - Comment update to bli_sumsqv_unb_var1.c.

    - Fixed a minor parameter checking bug in the BLAS compatibility layer
      for [sd]syrk and [sd]syr2k. Specifically, if 'C' is passed in for the
      trans parameter of either operation, it is (a) allowed, and (b) treated
      as 'T' (whereas previously it was disallowed). Thanks for Vladimir
      Sukharev for finding and reporting this bug.

    Added fusing factors, MR/NR to test suite output.
    
    Details:
    - Updated the test suite driver (and modules where appropriate) so that
      the level-1f fusing factors are output along with the variable dimension.
      While this is not strictly necessary, since the fusing factors are output
      in the initial parameter summary, it allows extra reassurance to the user
      since the fusing factors appear alongside the variable dimension, which
      together give a complete picture of the problem size. Similar changes were
      made for outputting the register blocksizes when reporting results for the
      micro-kernel test modules.

    Added test suite modules for level-1f, 3 kernels.
    
    Details:
    - Added test modules in test suite for level-1f kernels and level-3
      micro-kernels. (Duplication in the micro-kernels, for now, is NOT
      supported by these test modules.)
    - Added section override switches to test suite's input.operations file.
    - Added obj_t APIs for level-1f front-ends and their unblocked variants to
      facilitate the level-1f test modules. Also added front-end for dupl
      operation.
    - Added obj_t-based check routines for level-1f operations, which are
      called from the new front-ends mentioned above.
    - Added query routines for axpyf, dotxf, and dotxaxpyf that return fusing
      factors as a function of datatype, which is needed by their respective
      test modules.
    - Whitespace changes to bli_kernel.h of all existing configurations.

    Details:
    - Added new lines of input to the test suite's input.operations file, which
      allows the user to disable entire sections (levels) of tests. Before this
      change, the user had to manually disable each operation tests's "master
      switch". (This is why input.operations.0 existed: to allow a more
      convenient starting point for someone who only wanted to test one or a
      few operations.)

    Added template implementations and other tweaks.
    
    Details:
    - Added a 'template' configuration, which contains stub implementations of the
      level 1, 1f, and 3 kernels with one datatype implemented in C for each, with
      lots of in-file comments and documentation.
    - Modified some variable/parameter names for some 1/1f operations. (e.g.
      renaming vector length parameter from m to n.)
    - Moved level-1f fusing factors from axpyf, dotxf, and dotxaxpyf header files
      to bli_kernel.h.
    - Modifed test suite to print out fusing factors for axpyf, dotxf, and
      dotxaxpyf, as well as the default fusing factor (which are all equal
      in the reference and template implementations).
    - Cleaned up some sloppiness in the level-1f unb_var1.c files whereby these
      reference variants were implemented in terms of front-end routines rather
      that directly in terms of the kernels. (For example, axpy2v was implemented
      as two calls to axpyv rather than two calls to AXPYV_KERNEL.)
    - Changed the interface to dotxf so that it matches that of axpyf, in that
      A is assumed to be m x b_n in both cases, and for dotxf A is actually used
      as A^T.
    - Minor variable naming and comment changes to reference micro-kernels in
      frame/3/gemm/ukernels and frame/3/trsm/ukernels.

        IBM BG/Q
        IBM Power7
        AMD Piledriver
        Loogson 3A
      and reorganized kernels directory. Thanks to Tyler Smith, Mike Kistler,
      and Xianyi Zhang for contributing these kernels.
    - Added configurations corresponding to above architectures, and renamed
      "clarksville" configuration to "dunnington".

    Removed default configuration behavior.
    
    Details:
    - Changed the configure script so that it no longer defaults to the
      reference configuration. This change is being made so that the
      developer has a firm awareness of which configuration is being used
      to configure BLIS. Thanks to Mike Kistler and Bryan Marker for this
      suggested change.

    Minor improvements to static memory allocator.
    
    Details:
    - Expanded on cpp macro definitions from bli_mem.c and relocated them to
      a new header file, frame/include/bli_mem_pool_macro_defs.h. The expanded
      functionality includes computing the pool size for each datatype (using
      that datatype's cache blocksizes) and using the maximum to size the
      actual pool array. This addresses the somewhat common pitfall whereby a
      developer updates cache blocksizes in bli_kernel.h for only one datatype
      (say, single-precision real), while the memory pools are sized using the
      double-precision real values. Then, when the developer attempts to link
      to and run a level-3 BLIS routine (e.g. dgemm), the library aborts with
      a message saying the static memory pool was exhausted. Clearly, this
      message is misleading when the pool was not sized properly to begin with.
    - Removed previously disabled code in bli_kernel_macro_defs.h that was
      meant to check for size consistency among the various cache blocksizes.
      (Obviously the memory pool size-based solution mentioned above is better.)
    - Added BLIS_SIZEOF_? cpp macros to bli_type_defs.h. This seemed like a
      reasonable place to put these constants, rather than further crowd up
      bli_config.h.
    - Updated testsuite driver to output memory pool sizes for A, B, and C.
    - Minor comment updates to bli_config.h.
    - Removed 'flame' configuration. It was beginning to get out-of-date, and
      I hadn't used it in months. We can always re-create it later.

Date:   Tue Sep 10 16:35:12 2013 -0500

    Various changes to treatment of integers.
    
    Details:
    - Added a new cpp macro in bli_config.h, BLIS_INT_TYPE_SIZE, which can be
      assigned values of 32, 64, or some other value. The former two result in
      defining gint_t/guint_t in terms of 32- or 64-bit integers, while the latter
      causes integers to be defined in terms of a default type (e.g. long int).
    - Updated bli_config.h in reference and clarksville configurations according
      to above changes.
    - Updated test drivers in test and testsuite to avoid type warnings associated
      with format specifiers not matching the types of their arguments to printf()
      and scanf().
    - Inserted missing #include "bli_system.h" into blis.h (which was slated for
      inclusion in d141f9eeb6d1).
    - Added explicit typecasting of dim_t and inc_t to macros in
      bli_blas_macro_defs.h (which are used in BLAS compatibility layer).
    - Slight changes to CREDITS and INSTALL files.
    - Slight tweaks to Windows build system, mostly in the form of switching to
      Windows-style CRLF newlines for certain files.

      the functions. Special thanks to Karl Rupp for suggesting a portable fix
      for these warnings.

      similar to that of libflame's. Thanks to Martin for getting this up
      and running.
    - Spun off system header #includes into bli_system.h, which is included
      in blis.h
    - Added a Windows section to bli_clock.c (similar to libflame's).

    Falling back to 32-bit integers for dim_t, etc.
    
    Details:
    - In light of recent segfaulting issues when compiling on 32-bit systems,
      I've changed the default typedef for gint_t and guint_t from int64_t and
      uint64_t to int32_t and uint32_t, respectively.
    - Disabled 64-bit integers in the blas2blis layer for the reference
      configuration.
    - Added type sizes of gint_t, guint_t, and the four floating-point datatypes
      to introductory output of the testsuite.

    - Applied a temporary fix to the typecasting bug in the testsuite driver.
      The fix involves casting both numerator and denominator to unsigned long.
      This fix is more voodoo than science, as I can't be sure why it even

      independently from outputting to files.
    - Adjusted input.operations according to above.
    - Added input.operations.0 and input.operations.1 with all options
      disabled and enabled, respectively.

    Added single/real gemm micro-kernel for x86_64.
    
    Details:
    - Added a single-precision real gemm micro-kernel in
      kernels/x86_64/3/bli_gemm_opt_d4x4.c.
    - Adjusted the single-precision real register blocksizes in
      config/clarksville/bli_kernel.h to be 8x4.
    - Added a missing comment to bli_packm_blk_var2.c that was present in
      bli_packm_blk_var3.c

    Fixed bug in bli_acquire_mpart_t2b(), _l2r().
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in bli_acquire_mpart_t2b() and bli_acquire_mpart_l2r()
      that cause incorrect partitioning when SUBPART0 was requested. This
      bug was introduced in 46d3d09d49ad. Thanks to Bryan for isolating
      this bug.
    - Removed dupl kernels from kernels/x86_64/3 directory.
    - Uncommented beta == 0 optimizaition code in
      kernels/x86_64/3/bli_gemm_opt_d4x4.c.

    Moved init_safe(), finalize_safe() to BLAS compat.
    
    Details:
    - Moved the bli_init_safe() and bli_finalize_safe() function calls from the
      BLAS-like BLIS layer to the BLAS compatibility layer. Having these auto-
      initializers in the BLIS layer wasn't buying us anything because the user
      could still call the library with uninitialized global scalar constants,
      for example. Thus, we will just have to live with the constraint that
      bli_init() MUST be called before calling ANY routine with a bli_ prefix.
    - Added the missing _init_safe() and finalize_safe() calls to the level-1
      BLAS compatibility wrappers.

    Miscellaneous updates.
    
    Details:
    - Changed the BLIS_HEAP_STRIDE_ALIGN_SIZE in the configurations from 16 to
      BLIS_CACHE_LINE_SIZE (typically 64).
    - Changed the use of nr in sizing of bd buffer to packnr in level-3 macro-
      kernels.
    - Reformulated gemm_ker_var2 to look more like the other level-3 macro-
      kernels, in that the interior and edge-case handling is expressed once
      inside the loops in the n and m dimensions, rather than the edge-case
      handling being "unrolled" and expressed as distinct code regions. The
      previous macro-kernel now lives in retired form in the subdirectory
      other/bli_gemm_ker_var2.c.old.
    - Updated experimental gemm_ker_var5 according to above change.
    - Fixed bug in bli_her2k.c whereby incorrect transformations were being
      applied to optimize the macro-kernel accesses pattern on C when C is
      row-stored.
    - Various updates inside of test/exec_sizes.

    Fixed cpp guard typos in frame/compat/check files.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed instances of BLIS_ENABLE_BLIS2BLAS that should have been
      BLIS_ENABLE_BLAS2BLIS. Thanks to Tyler for catching this.
    - Fixed various syntax errors in the code that had yet to be compiled
      due to the aforementioned bug.

    Added basic OpenMP-based gemm and packm files.
    
    Details:
    - Integrated Tyler's parallelized packm_blk_var2 and gemm_ker_var2
      into the following auxiliary files
    
        frame/1m/packm/other/bli_packm_blk_var2.c
        frame/3/gemm/other/bli_gemm_ker_var2.c
    
      The routine in the first file uses a basic OpenMP parallel region to
      parallelize the packing of blocks of A and panels of B, while the
      second uses a similar parallel region to parallelize along the n
      dimension of the gemm macro-kernel.

      constraints on the register blocksizes relative to the cache blocksizes.
      Thanks to Tyler for helping me stumble across this issue.

    Details:
    - Fixed various warnings output by gcc 4.6.3-1, including removing some
      set-but-not-used variables and addressing some instances of typecasting
      of pointer types to integer types of different sizes.

    Tightened some macros that detect datatypes.
    
    Details:
    - Modified the definitions of some macros, such as bli_is_real(), so that
      the "special" bit is taken into account so that BLIS_INT is differentiated
      from BLIS_FLOAT.
    - Whitespace changes to bli_obj_macro_defs.h.
    - Removed BLIS_SPECIAL_BIT definition from bli_type_defs.h, since it wasn't
      being used.

Author: Field G. Van Zee <field@cs.utexas.edu>
Date:   Thu Jul 18 18:04:34 2013 -0500

    Added BLAS error checking to compatibility layer.
    
    Details:
    - Added frame/compat/check directory, which now houses companion _check()
      routines for each of the BLAS wrappers in frame/compat. These _check()
      routines are called from the compatibility wrappers and mimic the
      error-checking present in the netlib BLAS.
    - Edited bla_xerbla.c so that xerbla() translates the operation string to
      uppercase before printing.
    - Redefined util routines in frame/compat/f2c/util in terms of level0
      macros.
    - Added prototypes for util routines, f2c routines, lsame(), and xerbla().
    - Commented out prototypes in test/test_*.c since Fortran integers are now
      int64_t by default (and the prototypes that were present in the files
      used int).
    - Removed redundant #include "bli_f2c.h" in bli_?lamch.c and bli_lsame.c,
      since blis.h was already being included.
    - Other minor changes to code in frame/compat/f2c.

    Added support for C99 complex types/arithmetic.
    
    Details:
    - Added support for C99 complex types to bli_type_defs.h and overloaded
      complex arithmetic to the scalar-level macros in include/level0. This
      includes a somewhat substantial reorganization and re-layering of much
      of the existing machinery present in the level0 macros.
    - Added new #define for BLIS_ENABLE_C99_COMPLEX to bli_config.h files,
      commented-out by default, which optionally enables the use of built-in
      C99 complex types and arithmetic.
    - Minor changes to clarksville and reference configs' make_defs.mk files.
    - Removed macro definitions from bli_param_macro_defs.h which was not being
      used (bli_proj_dt_to_real_if_imag_eq0).

    Fixed bugs in trsm, trmm macro-kernels.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in trsm_rl_ker_var2() caused by incorrect edge case handling.
    - Fixed a bug in trsm_rl_ker_var2() and trsm_ru_ker_var2() whereby k was
      incorrectly being adjusted upward by MR, instead of NR. The rl and ru
      trmm macro-kernels were updated in a similar fashion.
    - Fixed a bug in trsm_ru_ker_var2() that was due to a missing negation on
      diagoffb when recomputing k to skip a zero region below where the
      diagonal intersects the right side of the block. The corresponding
      trmm macro-kernel was also updated.
    - Fixed a bug in trsm_ru_ker_var2() where the the adjustment of k (by NR)
      needed to be placed AFTER the block that recomputes k to skip the zero
      region (if present). The other three trsm macro-kernels, as well as the
      trmm macro-kernels, were updated in the same manner, for consistency.
    - Fixed a bug in trmm_lu_ker_var2() in which the wrong dimension (n) was
      being updated to skip a zero region to the left of where the diagonal
      of A intersects the top edge of the block.
    - Comment updates to all trsm and trmm macro-kernels.
    - Comment updates to bli_packm_init.c.

    Added f2c'ed Givens rotation wrappers.
    
    Details:
    - Retired (for now) existing ?rot*() BLAS compatibility wrappers to 'attic'
      along with other wrappers for which no BLIS implementation exists.
    - Added f2c-generated codes for applicable datatype flavors of rot, rotg,
      rotm, and rotmg operations.

    Removed copynzv, copynzm and related codes.
    
    Details:
    - Removed copynzv and copynzm operation directories. These operations
      implemented a variation of copyv/m that, in the case of real source
      and complex destination operands, leaves the imaginary component
      untouched (rather than setting it to zero). I realize now that the
      special case(s) (e.g. gemm with real A and B but complex C) that I
      thought required this operation actually can be handled more simply.
    - Removed level0 scalar macros implementing copynzs, copynzjs.

    Added handling of restrict, stdint.h for non-C99.
    
    Details:
    - Removed the #include <stdint.h> from blis.h and inserted a cpp macro block
      in bli_type_defs.h that #includes <stdint.h> for C++ and C99, and otherwise
      manually typedefs the types we need (which, for now, are unconditionally
      int64_t and uint64_t).
    - Moved basic typedefs to top of bli_type_defs.h, and comment changes.
    - Added cpp macro block to bli_macro_defs.h that #defines restrict as
      nothing for C++ and non-C99.

Author: Field G. Van Zee <field@cs.utexas.edu>
Date:   Mon Jul 8 15:20:34 2013 -0500

    Migrated integer usage to stdint.h types.
    
    Details:
    - Changed the way bli_type_defs.h defines integer types so that dim_t,
      inc_t, doff_t, etc. are all defined in terms of gint_t (general signed
      integer) or guint_t (general unsigned integer).
    - Renamed Fortran types fchar and fint to f77_char and f77_int.
    - Define f77_int as int64_t if a new configuration variable,
      BLIS_ENABLE_BLIS2BLAS_INT64, is defined, and int32_t otherwise.
      These types are defined in stdint.h, which is now included in blis.h.
    - Renamed "complex" type in f2c files to "singlecomplex" and typedef'ed
      in terms of scomplex.
    - Renamed "char" type in f2c files to "character" and typedef'ed in terms
      of char.
    - Updated bla_amax() wrappers so that the return type is defined directly
      as f77_int, rather than letting the prototype-generating macro decide
      the type. This was the only use of GENTFUNC2I/GENTPROT2I-related macros,
      so I removed them. Also, changed the body of the wrapper so that a
      gint_t is passed into abmaxv, which is THEN typecast to an f77_int
      before returning the value.
    - Updated f2c code that accessed .r and .i fields of complex and
      doublecomplex types so that they use .real and .imag instead (now that
      we are using scomplex and dcomplex).

    Added experimental bli_gemm_ker_var5().
    
    Details:
    - Added support for an experimental gemm macro-kernel incrementally
      packs one micro-panel of B at a time. This is useful for certain
      special cases of gemm where m is small.
    - Minor changes to default values of clarksville configuration.
    - Defined BLIS_PACKED_BLOCKS as part of pack_t type, even though we
      do not yet have any use (or implementation support) for block storage.
    - Comment update to bli_packm_init.c.

    Defined "total" blocksize query functions.
    
    Details:
    - Defined bli_blksz_total_for_type() and bli_blksz_total_for_obj() to query
      the default blocksize plus blocksize extension (using the type or the type
      of an object).
    - Comment update in bli_packm_cxk.c.

    Consolidated lower/upper her[2]k blocked variants.
    
    Details:
    - Consolidated lower and upper blocked variants for herk and her2k, and
      renamed the resulting variants, according to the same changes recently
      made to trmm and trsm.
    - Implemented support for four new subpartitions types:
        BLIS_SUBPART1T
        BLIS_SUBPART1B
        BLIS_SUBPART1L
        BLIS_SUBPART1R
      which correspond to "merged" partitions that include the middle "1"
      partition as well as either the neighboring "0" or "2" partition. This is
      used to clean up code in herk/her2k var2 that attempts to partition away
      the strictly zero region above or below the diagonal of a matrix operand
      that is being marched through diagonally.
    - Added safeguards to herk macro-kernels that skip any leading or trailing
      zero region in the panel of C that is passed in. This is now needed given
      that herk/her2k var1 no longer partitions off this zero region before
      calling the macro-kernel (via bli_her[2]k_int()).
    - Updated comments and other whitespace changes to trmm/trsm macro-kernels.

    Added row-storage optimizations for trmm, trsm.
    
    Details:
    - Implemented algorithmic optimizations for trmm and trsm whereby the right
      side case is now handled explicitly, rather than induced indirectly by
      transposing and swapping strides on operands. This allows us to walk through
      the output matrix with favorable access patterns no matter how it is stored,
      for all parameter combinations.
    - Renamed trmm and trsm blocked variants so that there is no longer a
      lower/upper distinction. Instead, we simply label the variants by which
      dimension is partitioned and whether the variant marches forwards or
      backwards through the corresponding partitioned operands.
    - Added support for row-stored packing of lower and upper triangular matrices
      (as provided by bli_packm_blk_var3.c).
    - Fixed a performance bug in bli_determine_blocksize_b() whereby the cache
      blocksize  extensions (if non-zero) were not being used to appropriately size
      the first iteration (ie: the bottom/right edge case).
    - Updated comments in bli_kernel.h to indicate that both MC and NC must be
      whole multiples of MR AND NR. This is needed for the case of trsm_r where,
      in order to reuse existing left-side gemmtrsm fused micro-kernels, the
      packing of A (left-hand operand) and B (right-hand operand) is done with
      NR and MR, respectively (instead of MR and NR).

    Use separate CFLAGS for "kernels" directories.
    
    Details:
    - Added a new "special" directory type: any source code within directories
      named "kernels" will be compiled with a separate CFLAGS_KERNELS set of
      compiler flags. This allows the developer to specify a separate set of
      flags (e.g. optimization flags) for compiling kernels while maintaining a
      standard set for regular framework code.
    - Fixed a bug in the top-level Makefile that was causing "noopt" code
      to be compiled with the standard set of compilation flags.
    - Updated make_defs.mk in reference, flame, and clarksville configurations
      according to above changes.

    Various level-3 optimizations for row storage.
    
    Details:
    - Implemented remaining two cases within bli_packm_blk_var2(), which allow
      packing from a lower or upper-stored symmetric/Hermitian matrix to column
      panels (which are row-stored). Previously one could only pack to row panels
      (which are column-stored).
    - Implemented various optimizations in the level-3 front-ends that allow more
      favorable access through row-stored matrices for gemm, hemm, herk, her2k,
      symm, syrk, and syr2k.
    - Cleaned up code in level-3 front-ends that has to do with setting target and
      execution datatypes.

    Added beta == 0 optimization to x86_64 ukernel.
    
    Details:
    - Modified x86_64 gemm microkernel so that when beta is zero, C is not read
      from memory (nor scaled by beta).
    - Fixed minor bug in test suite driver when "Test all combinations of storage
      schemes?" switch is disabled, which would result in redundant tests being
      executed for matrix-only (e.g. level-1m, level-3) operations if multiple
      vector storage schemes were specified.
    - Restored debug flags as default in clarksville configuration.

    Fixed unaligned handling in axpyf, dotxaxpyf.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed over-cautious handling of unaligned operands in vector instrinsic
      implementation of axpyf kernel.
    - Fixed over- and under-cautious handling of unaligned operands in vector
      intrinsic implementation of dotxaxpyf kernel.

    Updated level-1/-1f [vector intrinsic] kernels.
    
    Details:
    - Updated level-1/-1f kernels so that non-unit and un-aligned cases are
      handled by reference implementation (rather than aborted).
    - Added -fomit-frame-pointer to default make_defs.mk for clarksville
      configuration.
    - Defined bli_offset_from_alignment() macro.
    - Minor edits to old test drivers.

    Updated ukernels for x86_64.
    
    Details:
    - Tweaked micro-kernels and configuration for clarksville.
    - Updated/cleaned up old test drivers in test directory.
    - Fixed syntax bug in trsv_unb_var1 and trsv_unf_var1 (introduced
      recently).

    Replaced axpys usage with subs in trsv.
    
    Details:
    - Replaced instances of axpys with alpha equal to -1 with subs.
    - Use BLIS_MAX_TYPE_SIZE to define BLIS_CONSTANT_SLOT_SIZE instead of
      sizeof(dcomplex).

    Fixed x86_64 kernel bugs and other minor issues.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed bugs in trmv_l and trsv_u due to backwards iteration resulting in
      unaligned subpartitions. We were already going out of our way a bit to
      handle edge cases in the first iteration for blocked variants, and this
      was simply the unblocked-fused extension of that idea.
    - Fixed control tree handling in her/her2/syr/syr2 that was not taking
      into account how the choice of variant needed to be altered for
      upper-stored matrices (given that only lower-stored algorithms are
      explicitly implemented).
    - Added bli_determine_blocksize_dim_f(), bli_determine_blocksize_dim_b()
      macros to provide inlined versions of bli_determine_blocksize_[fb]() for
      use by unblocked-fused variants.
    - Integrated new blocksize_dim macros into gemv/hemv unf variants for
      consistency with that of the bugfix for trmv/trsv (both of which now
      use the same macros).
    - Modified bli_obj_vector_inc() so that 1 is returned if the object is a
      vector of length 1 (ie: 1 x 1). This fixes a bug whereby under certain
      conditions (e.g. dotv_opt_var1), an invalid increment was returned, which
      was invalid only because the code was expecting 1 (for purposes of
      performing contiguous vector loads) but got a value greater than 1 because
      the column stride of the object (e.g. rho) was inflated for alignment
      purposes (albeit unnecessarily since there is only one element in the
      object).
    - Replaced some old invocations of set0 with set0s.
    - Added alpha parameter to gemmtrsm ukernels for x86_64 and use accordingly.
    - Fixed increment bug in cleanup loop of gemm ukernel for x86_64.
    - Added safeguard to test modules so that testing a problem with a zero
      dimension does not result in a failure.
    - Tweaked handling of zero dimensions in level-2 and level-3 operations'
      internal back-ends to correctly handle cases where output operand still
      needs to be scaled (e.g. by beta, in the case of gemm with k = 0).

    - Mistakenly forgot to rename the _trans_status() macro and instances in
      previous commit.

    Renamed _set_trans(), _trans_status() macros.
    
    Details:
    - Renamed the following macros:
        bli_obj_set_trans()    -> bli_obj_set_onlytrans()
        bli_obj_trans_status() -> bli_obj_onlytrans_status()
      to remove ambiguity as to which bits are read/updated.

    Unconditionally check memory pool(s) for errors.
    
    Details:
    - Changed bli_mem_acquire_m() in bli_mem.c so that we still check if the
      memory pool is exhausted before checking out and returning a block, even
      if BLIS error checking has been disabled. These errors are useful because
      they likely indicate that BLIS was improperly configured for the code
      being run.

Date:   Tue Apr 30 19:35:54 2013 -0500

    Absorbed blocksize extensions into main objects.
    
    Details:
    - Revamped some parts of commit b6ef84fad1c9 by adding blocksize extension
      fields to the blksz_t object rather than have them as separate structs.
    - Updated all packm interfaces/invocations according to above change.
    - Generalized bli_determine_blocksize_?() so that edge case optimization
      happens if and only if cache blocksizes are created with non-zero
      extensions.
    - Updated comments in bli_kernel.h files to indicate that the edge case
      blocksize extension mechanism is now available for use.

    Added option to disable err checking in testsuite.
    
    Details:
    - Added a new line to input.general that allows one to specify the error-
      checking level to use for each BLIS experiment. The only two levels
      supported for now are "no error checking" and "full error checking".

    Use cntl trees that block in n dimension.
    
    Details:
    - Updated _cntl.c files for each level-3 operation to induce blocked
      algorithms that first paritition in the n dimension with a blocksize
      of NC. Typically this is not an issue since only very large problems
      exceed that of NC. But developers often run very large problems, and
      so this extra blocking should be the default.
    - Removed some recently introduced but now unused macros from
      bli_param_macro_defs.h.

    Use PASTEMAC in macro-kernels (over MAC2 or MAC3).
    
    Details:
    - Replaced multi-type invocations of copys_mxn, xpbys_mxn, etc. (PASTEMAC2
      and PASTEMAC3) with those that only use a single type (PASTEMAC).
    - Added extra macros to bli_adds_mxn_uplo.h and bli_xpbys_mxn_uplo.h to
      accommodate above change.
    - Fixed comment typo in bli_config.h files.
    - Added .nfs* pattern to .gitignore.

    Fixed computation of b_next in L3 macro-kernels.
    
    Details:
    - Restructured herk_l and herk_u macro-kernels in the imagine of trmm
      and trsm, in that the edge cases are captured by the main loop, rather
      than trying to have "cleanup" sections that result in four distinct
      parts (interior, bottom edge, right edge, bottom-right edge) of the
      code.
    - Fixed the way b_next was being computed in the non-gemm level-3
      macro-kernels (herk, trmm, trsm). The way they are computed now matches
      that of gemm.

    Fixed rare edge case bug in herk_l macro-kernel.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a potential bug in herk_l at the m_left edge case. If MR was
      chosen to be much larger than NR, then one could encounter edge cases
      in the the MC dimension that fall entirely below the diagonal, which
      the previous implementation of the herk_l macro-kernel was not allowing
      for.

Author: Field G. Van Zee <field@cs.utexas.edu>
Date:   Tue Apr 23 16:00:18 2013 -0500

    Added a_next, b_next arguments to micro-kernels.
    
    Details:
    - Added two more arguments to the gemm and gemmtrsm microkernels: the
      addresses of the next micro-panels of A and B. By passing these
      pointers into the micro-kernel, we allow the micro-kernel author to
      prefetch micro-panels of A and B as necessary (though this is
      completely optional; these addresses may also be safely ignored).
    - Updated all seven macro-kernels so that they compute and pass in
      a_next and b_next. Note that ONLY the gemm macro-kernel computes
      a_next and b_next with the precise semantics we want. I will go back
      and fix the other macro-kernels in the near future.
    - Added 'restrict' to various micro-kernels from which it was missing.

    Added code for backward edge-case blocking.
    
    Disabled:
    - Edited bli_determine_blocksize_b() to include experimental (and
      currently disabled) code that computes extended blocks.
    - Updated commnts relate to above changes.
    - Enabled use of x86 gemmtrsm ukernel in config/flame/bli_kernel.h.

    Updated dupl implementation to use PACKNR and NR.
    
    Details:
    - Updated frame/util/dupl/bli_dupl_unb_var1.c to utilize PACKNR and NR
      explicitly so navigate b1 so that situations where PACKNR > NR are
      supported.
    - Moved the 4x2 and 4x4 reference micro-kernels in frame/3/gemm/ukernels and
      frame/3/trsm/ukernels to kernels/c99/.
    - Updated clarksville and flame configurations.

    Disabled blocksize checks for memory pools.
    
    Details:
    - Temporarily disabled checks that ensure that enough memory will be allocated
      by the contiguous memory allocator for all types, given that the values for
      double precision real are the ones used to allocate the space. These checks
      can easily go awry in certain situations, especially if you are developing for
      only one datatype. So for now, they are probably more trouble than they are
      worth.

    Allow ldim of packed micro-panels != MR, NR.
    
    Details:
    - Made substantial changes throughout the framework to decouple the leading
      dimension (row or column stride) used within each packed micro-panel from
      the corresponding register blocksize. It appears advantageous on some
      systems to use, for example, packed micro-panels of A where the column
      stride is greater than MR (whereas previously it was always equal to MR).
    - Changes include:
      - Added BLIS_EXTEND_[MNK]R_? macros, which specify how much extra padding
        to use when packing micro-panels of A and B.
      - Adjusted all packing routines and macro-kernels to use PACKMR and PACKNR
        where appropriate, instead of MR and NR.
      - Added pd field (panel dimension) to obj_t.
      - New interface to bli_packm_cntl_obj_create().
      - Renamed bli_obj_packed_length()/_width() macros to
        bli_obj_padded_length()/_width().
      - Removed local #defines for cache/register blocksizes in level-3 *_cntl.c.
      - Print out new cache and register blocksize extensions in test suite.
    - Also added new BLIS_EXTEND_[MNK]C_? macros for future use in using a larger
      blocksize for edge cases, which can improve performance at the margins.

    Fixed bug in compatibility layer (her2k/syr2k).
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in the BLAS compatibility layer, specifically in bla_her2k.c
      and bla_syr2k.c, that caused incorrect computation to occur when the BLAS
      interface caller requests the [conjugate-]transpose case. Thanks to Bryan
      Marker for reporting the behavior that led to this bug.

    Changed old level3 test drivers to call front-ends.
    
    Details:
    - Changed old level-3 test drivers, in 'test' directory, to always call the
      front-end object API instead of the internal back-end with the locally
      defined control tree.

    Allow packm_init() to reacquire a too-small mem_t.
    
    Details:
    - Changed bli_packm_init() to react differently to a situation where a pack
      obj_t has an already-allocated mem_t entry that has a buffer that is smaller
      than what will be needed to hold the block/panel that now needs to be
      packed. Previously, this situation was treated with an abort() since I
      assumed something was horribly wrong. I have changed the code so that it now
      reacts by releasing the previous mem_t and re-acquires a new mem_t with the
      new information. (This change was done at the request of Bryan Marker to
      facilitate code generation via DxT.)

    Fixed bug in packing block of A for hemm/symm.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in bli_packm_blk_var2() that affected the packing functionality
      of hemm and symm. The bug occurs whenever attempting to pack a Hermitian or
      symmetric matrix where the block of A being packed intersects the diagonal,
      but some of its micro-panels do not intersect the diagonal and lie completely
      in the unstored region. Thanks to Francisco Igual for reporting this bug.
    - Comment updates to both _blk_var2.c and _blk_var3.c.

    Activated bli_packm_acquire_mpart_t2b().
    
    Details:
    - Removed the overly-paranoid bli_abort() from the end of
      bli_packm_acquire_mpart_t2b(), to allow others to experiment with
      partitioning through packed blocks of A. Also, and more importantly,
      changed an earlier check that was causing an erroneous (but
      coincidentally redundant) abort(). Also, updated some of the comments
      in bli_packm_part.c.

    Details:
    - Modified bli_obj_alloc_buffer() to allow allocating an empty buffer, and
      modified bli_adjust_strides() to explicitly handle m = n = 0.
    - Updated bli_check_matrix_strides() to allow cases where m = n = 0.

    Fixed "root" object bug in bli_her[2]k/syr[2]k.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed an obscure bug in the front-ends for herk, her2k, syrk, and syr2k,
      that manifested as the incorrect triangle being updated. It occurred when
      the user would pass in a matrix object that was correctly marked as
      symmetric/Hermitian and lower-stored, but whose root object was never marked
      as lower (or upper). We now alias and re-assign root status for matrix C
      within the front-ends. Note that trmm and trsm were already doing this,
      albeit for a slightly different reason (to allow the internal back-end to
      choose which algorithm to run--lower or upper--based on the uplo of the root
      object for both left and right side cases). Thanks to Bryan Marker for
      leading me to this bug.

    Fixed overzealous type-checking in bli_getsc().
    
    Details:
    - Relaxed type checking in getsc so that the input object could be a constant
      and not just a proper floating-point type. (If it is a constant, default to
      extracting the dcomplex values.) Thanks to Bryan Marker for reporting this
      bug.
    - Added definition for bli_is_constant() in bli_param_macro_defs.h
    - Comment updates to various level-0 scalar routines.

    Fixed bug in bli_obj_is_packed() and renamed.
    
    Details:
    - This macro is used to determine whether the partitioning routines should
      call a corresponding packm_part routine instead. However, it was
      unintentionally catching matrices that were marked as "packed" by virtue
      of them simply being marked as BLIS_PACKED_UNSPEC in, say, bli_gemv().
      The macro has now been renamed to bli_obj_is_panel_packed(), and now only
      checks for row or column panel packing. (Note that I first attempted to
      fix this bug in a571af816d72.) Thanks to Bryan Marker for reporting the
      erroneous behavior that led me to this bug.

    Tweak to test suite function string construction.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a minor bug in the way that the test suite would construct function
      name strings when the user anchored all parameters in input.operations.
      In this case, the test driver would mistake this situation for one where
      the operation simply had no parameters to begin with, and thus would not
      include the parameter string in the function string that is output for
      every result.

    Fixed a bug in reference implementation of dupl.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in reference implementation of dupl (bli_dupl_unb_var1.c),
      which resulted in incorrect duplication.
    - Updated old test drivers according to recently updated packm control tree
      creation interface.
    - Added 'restrict' to x86 gemm microkernel interface.

    Modified bli_kernel.h include order in blis.h.
    
    Details:
    - Delayed #include of bli_kernel.h in blis.h to prevent a situation where
      _kernel.h includes an optimized microkernel header, which uses BLIS types
      such as dim_t and inc_t, which would precede the definition of those types
      in bli_type_defs.h.
    - Moved the #include of bli_kernel_macro_defs.h in bli_macro_defs.h to blis.h
      (immediately after that of bli_kernel.h).

    Removed gemmtrsm-, trsm-specific blocksize macros.
    
    Details:
    - Modified gemmtrsm micro-kernel wrappers to use new aliased blocksize macros
      instead of operation-specific ones.
    - Removed local, gemmtrsm-specific blocksize macro definitions found in
      micro-kernel header files.
      (Meant to include above changes in 31b100e7bf4a.)
    - Added comments to reference gemmtrsm micro-kernel wrapper implementation.

Author: Field G. Van Zee <field@cs.utexas.edu>
Date:   Fri Apr 12 15:25:54 2013 -0500

    Added/renamed alignment constants to _config.h.
    
    Details:
    - Added new memory alignment constants:
        BLIS_HEAP_STRIDE_ALIGN_SIZE   (previously assumed to be same as SYSTEM_MEM)
        BLIS_CONTIG_ADDR_ALIGN_SIZE   (previously assumed to be same as PAGE_SIZE)
        BLIS_STACK_BUF_ALIGN_SIZE     (previously not enforced)
      and renamed existing ones
        BLIS_SYSTEM_MEM_ALIGN_SIZE -> BLIS_HEAP_ADDR_ALIGN_SIZE
        BLIS_CONTIG_MEM_ALIGN_SIZE -> BLIS_CONTIG_STRIDE_ALIGN_SIZE
      to better convey what the alignment factor is used for (and what it is
      not used for).
    - Removed BLIS_ENABLE_SYSTEM_MEM_ALIGN. Dynamic memory alignment is now
      disabled by setting BLIS_HEAP_STRIDE_ALIGN_SIZE to 1.
    - Inserted instances of __attribute__((aligned(BLIS_STACK_BUF_ALIGN_SIZE)))
      into macro-kernels to specify stack alignment of temporary buffers.
    - Modified test suite driver to output new constants.
    - Removed bli_align_dim_to_sys() and bli_align_dim_to_cmem(). Instead, we now
      use bli_align_dim_to_size(), which takes a third argument (the desired
      alignment).

    Fixed an bug in axpyv/axpym when alpha is unit.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed bug whereby axpyv and axpym were incorrectly simplifying to a copy,
      rather than an add, when alpha = 1. Thanks to Bryan Marker for identifying
      this bug.

    Moved _POSIX_C_SOURCE def to compiler cmd line.
    
    Details:
    - Removed the #define of _POSIX_C_SOURCE in bli_config.h (for both reference
      and clarksville configurations) and added "-D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200112L" to
      the compiler command line arguments in make_defs.mk (for both configs).
      Thanks to Devin Matthews for suggesting this change.

    Appended 'f2c_' to abs, min, max macros in f2c.h.
    
    Details:
    - Renamed abs, min, max, dmin, and dmax macros in bli_f2c.h so that they
      would not conflict with anything defined by the user (or the language).
      Thanks to Devin Matthews for suggesting this fix.
    - Updated all instances of the above macros accordingly.

    Added new kernel blocksize macro aliases.
    
    Details:
    - Added new macros that alias level-3 cache and register blocksize macros
      to names that can be constructed via the PASTEMAC macro. These aliased
      macro definitions live inside bli_kernel_macro_defs.h, which is now
      #included after bli_kernel.h.
    - Modified macro-kernels to use new aliased blocksize macros instead of
      operation-specific ones.
    - Removed local, operation-specific kernel blocksize macro definitions
      (found in macro-kernel header files).

    Reverted testsuite object files' home to 'obj'.
    
    Details:
    - Removed 'obj' and 'lib' from .gitignore.
    - Added testsuite/obj/.gitkeep (which is an empty file).
    - Updated testsuite/Makefile accordingly.
    - Thanks to Vernon Austel for pointing out the .gitkeep trick to tracking
      empty directories in git.

    Renamed/moved object scalar constant macros.
    
    Details:
    - Replaced scalar constant macro definitions in bli_const_defs.h with a single,
      simplier macro in bli_obj_macro_defs.h.
    - Updated invocations of old macros accordingly.
    - Removed bli_const_defs.h.

    Fixed a performance bug in trsm.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in the reference implementations of the gemmtrsm wrappers
      (bli_gemmtrsm_l_ref_mxn.c and bli_gemmtrsm_u_ref_mxn.c) whereby the
      reference gemm microkernel was hard-coded, and thus always called, even
      when GEMM_UKERNEL was defined to point to an optimzied microkernel. This
      manifested as artificially low trsm performance for all problem sizes, but
      especially for small problem sizes as it only affected blocks of A that
      intersected the diagonal. Thanks to Mike Kistler of IBM for helping me
      find this bug.

    Generate testsuite objects 'src'.
    
    Details:
    - Tweaked the testsuite makefile so that object files are stored in 'src'
      rather than 'obj', since (a) the top-level .gitignore dictates that
      obj directories are to be ignored, and (b) since git has problems
      tracking empty directories. Now, users do not need to create their own
      obj directories within their own local clones of BLIS.

    Fixed definition of bli_is_packed_object() macro.
    
    Details:
    - Changed the definition of bli_is_packed_object() so that it keys off of the
      value of the pack schema bits in the info field of obj_t, rather than
      comparing the obj_t buffer with that of the mem_t entry. This was the cause
      of a very low probability bug whereby uninitialized memory caused the macro
      to evaluate to TRUE even though the object in question was not packed.
      Thanks to Vernon Austel of IBM for helping discover this bug.
    - Changed an abort() in bli_packm_part() to a not-yet-implemented.

    Fixed edge case handling bug in herk macrokernels.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug present in bli_herk_l_ker_var2() and bli_herk_u_ker_var2() that
      only manifests when BLIS is configured such that MR != NR. The bug involves
      incorrectly detecting edge cases, which resulted in some parts of matrix C
      potentially being skipped and not updated, depending on the problem size.
    - Updated the default values of MR and NR in config/reference/bli_kernel.h to
      8 and 4, respectively, so that I can better stress the framework on a
      day-to-day basis. (The fact that they were both equal to 4 for so long is
      why I did not stumble upon this bug much sooner.)

Author: Field G. Van Zee <field@cs.utexas.edu>
Date:   Thu Apr 4 15:25:43 2013 -0500

    Added reference microkernels for arbitrary MR, NR.
    
    Details:
    - Added a new set of reference gemm, gemmtrsm, and trsm micro-kernels that
      contain explicit loops over MR and NR, thus allowing them to be used
      unmodified by developers who want to build a reference library with
      custom register blocksizes.
    - Changed config/reference/bli_kernel.h to use above ukernels by default.
    - Changed interfaces of new and existing gemm, gemmtrsm, and trsm micro-kernels
      to use 'restrict' keyword.
    - Added -funroll-loops option to config/reference/make_defs.mk.
    - Updated comments in bli_kernel.h describing constraints on register and
      cache blocksizes.
    - Updated _adds_mxn.h, _copys_mxn.h, and _xpbys_mxn.h macros files so that
      single-char macros are also defined.

    Details:
    - Implemented amax operation in BLIS.
    - Activated BLAS2BLIS routine mapping for new amax BLIS implementation.
    - Added integer support to [f]printv, [f]printm.
    - Added integer support to level-0 copys macros.
    - Updated printing of configuration information in test suite driver.
    - Comment changes to _config.h files.
    - Added comments to bla_dot.c to reminder reader what sdsdot()/dsdot() are
      used for.

    More memory alignment-related tweaks.
    
    Details:
    - Renamed BLIS_MEMORY_ALIGNMENT_SIZE to BLIS_CONTIG_MEM_ALIGN_SIZE.
    - Renamed BLIS_ENABLE_MEMORY_ALIGNMENT to BLIS_ENABLE_SYSTEM_MEM_ALIGN.
    - Added BLIS_SYSTEM_MEM_ALIGN_SIZE, which controls only the alignment
      passed into posix_memalign() or equivalent.
    - Defined new function, bli_align_dim_to_cmem(), which applies the
      contiguous memory alignment (rather than the system/malloc alignment).

    Always define memory alignment size cpp constant.
    
    Details:
    - Removed guard around #define for memory alignment size constant.
      Memory alignment should always be enabled, and so this value should
      always be defined.

    Align packed panel strides with system alignment.
    
    Details:
    - Pass panel strides through bli_align_dim_to_sys() to ensure that each
      subsequent packed panel of A and B begins at an aligned address. (The
      first panel is presumably aligned to system alignment because it is
      aligned to a page boundary, which is typically much larger.)
    - Rearranged code in packm_init_pack() to prevent additional conditional
      blocks as a result of the aforementioned change.
    - Adjusted contiguous memory allocator so that the system memory alignment
      is used to allocate enough space for each block no matter what kind of
      register blocking is used (even if register blocksize is unit and every
      row/column needs maximal padding).
    - Adjusted default blocksizes in reference configuration so that MC*KC
      and KC*NC result in identical footprints for all datatypes.

    Removed #include "blis2.h" from low-level headers.
    
    Details:
    - Removed #include of "blis2.h" from various lower-level, operation-specific
      header files throughout the framework. Given that these low-level headers
      are included within #blis2.h in a very specific order, #include'ing blis2.h
      within them directly is unnecessary.

    Added cpp guards to conflicting libflame typedefs.
    
    Details:
    - Added cpp guards around the definitions of dim_t, scomplex, and dcomplex.
      This is a temporary hack to allow interoperability with libflame. (Similarly
      temporary changes are being made to libflame's type definitions file.)

    Details:
    - Renamed BLIS_MAX_PREFETCH_BYTE_OFFSET to
      BLIS_MAX_PRELOAD_BYTE_OFFSET since "prefetch" is kind of a loaded word
      (e.g. "prefetch" instructions, which are different than the particular

    Relocated packed mem_t dimension fields to obj_t.
    
    Details:
    - Removed the m and n (and elem_size) fields from the mem_t object, and added
      m_packed and n_packed fields to obj_t. These new fields track the same as
      the old ones. From an abstraction standpoint, it seemed awkward to store
      those dimensions inside the mem_t.
    - Updated interfaces to bl2_mem_acquire_*() so that only a byte size argument
      is passed in, instead of m, n, and elem_size.
    - Updated bl2_packm_init_pack() and bl2_packv_init_pack() to inline the
      functionality of bl2_mem_alloc_update_m() and bl2_mem_alloc_update_v(),
      respectively.
    - Updated packm variants to access the packed length and width fields from
      their new locations.

    Re-implemented contiguous memory allocator.
    
    Details:
    - Completely re-wrote the contiguous memory allocator (bl2_mem.c). The new
      allocator instantiates and initializes three separate memory pool objects,
      each one associated with a separate array of contiguous memory blocks, each
      block of fixed and uniform size. (The three pools are for allocating mc-by-kc
      blocks of A, kc-by-nc panels of B, and mc-by-nc panels of C.) The pool
      objects use a stack structure internally to track which blocks in the region
      have been "checked out" to a thread and which are still available. Critical
      regions are now clearly marked and adaptable to parallel environments (e.g.
      OpenMP). Memory pools are set up when bl2_init() is called.
    - Added a new field to the packm control tree node, which indicates what kind
      of packed buffer is being allocated. The enumerated type for this argument
      is defined as packbuf_t in bl2_type_defs.h.
    - Updated level-3 _cntl.c files to pass in the appropriate value for a new
      packbuf_t argument to bl2_packm_cntl_obj_create().
    - Moved some macros called by packm_init_pack() from bl2_obj_macro_defs.h to
      bl2_mem_macro_defs.h.
    - Added BLIS_MAX_NUM_THREADS to bl2_config.h, which we use as the default
      number of blocks of A reserved for the memory allocator.
    - Deprecated bl2_align_dim(). Replaced usage with that of
      bl2_align_dim_to_mult(). Turns out that typically we don't need to align
      a dimension to the system alignment, since that value has to do with
      starting addresses, whereas the values we are dealing with are unitless
      dimensions.

    Perform her2k var1 loops in sequence.
    
    Details:
    - Changed variant 1 of her2k so that the two rank-k products are computed
      and accumulated in sequence rather than fused into one loop. This is
      necessary if BLIS is to be configured to provide only enough contiguous
      memory for one panel of B.

    Enhanced tracking of dimensions for mem_t objects.
    
    Details:
    - Added new fields to mem_t struct definition to track the allocated (as
      opposed to the currently used) dimensions of the memory region. This
      allows packm_init() to be more robust in situations where memory is
      already allocated but is more than needed for the current packing job.
    - Updated logic in bl2_obj_set_buffer_with_cached_packm_mem() macro, used
      in packm_init(), to update the "currently used" dimensions of the mem_t
      object if the requested dimensions are smaller than the allocated
      dimensions.

      running 'git status', or accidentally get pulled into the index when
      running 'git add' or 'git add --all'.

    Updated behavior of bl2_obj_induce_trans() macro.
    
    Details:
    - Changed bl2_obj_induce_trans() so that the transposition bit is no longer
      updated as part of the macro. All current uses of the macro have been
      coupled with instances of bl2_obj_set_trans() to clear the bit.
    - Added Jed to CREDITS file.

    Replaced banded/packed BLAS2 stubs with f2c code.
    
    Details:
    - Retired the blas2blis wrappers that simply called abort with a "not yet
      implemented" message. This includes all of the level-2 banded and packed
      routines.
    - Replaced the aforementioned with the corresponding netlib implementations
      having been run through f2c (with some customization).
    - Added directories named 'attic' to build/gen-make-frags/ignore_list.

    Details:
    - Moved the Fortran-77 name-mangling macros from bl2_blas_macro_defs.h to the
      configuration directory (bl2_config.h, specifically) given that it can be
      expected to be tweaked by some developers.

Date:   Fri Feb 22 12:11:24 2013 -0600

    Implemented blas2blis compatibility layer.
    
    Details:
    - Added the blas2blis compatibility layer, located in frame/compat. This
      includes virtually all of the BLAS, including banded and packed level-2
      operations.
    
    - Defined bl2_init_safe(), bl2_finalize_safe(). The former allows a conditional
      initialization, which stores the "exit status" in an err_t, which is then
      read by the latter function to determine whether finalization should actually
      take place.
    - Added calls to bl2_init_safe(), bl2_finalize_safe() to all level-2 and
      level-3 BLAS-like wrappers.
    - Added configuration option to instruct BLIS to remain initialized whenever
      it automatically initializes itself (via bl2_init_safe()), until/unless the
      application code explicitly calls bl2_finalize().
    
    - Added INSERT_GENTFUNC* and INSERT_GENTPROT* macros to facilitate type
      templatization of blas2blis wrappers.
    - Defined level-0 scalar macro bl2_??swaps().
    - Defined level-1v operation bl2_swapv().
    - Defined some "Fortran" types to bl2_type_defs.h for use with BLAS
      wrappers.

    Fixed some scalar types in BLAS-like Herm APIs.
    
    Details:
    - Some of the scalars of Hermitian operations, such as alpha in her,
      alpha and beta in herk, and beta in her2k, need to be real. These
      arguments were typed incorrectly as the complex types. This has been
      fixed. Note the issue was only present in the BLAS-like APIs for
      these operations (not the native object-based interfaces).

    Changed API of packm_init_pack() to use blksz_t.
    
    Details:
    - Changed the interface of packm_init_pack() so that mult_m and mult_n
      are passed in as type blksz_t* instead of dim_t.
    - Make similar change for packv_init_pack().

    Minor changes to lower levels of scalm and setm.
    
    Details:
    - Removed diagx parameter from lower-level interfaces of scalm.
    - Modified scalm_basic_check() to expect an object with a nonunit diagonal.
    - Changed setm_unb_var1() so that having an implicit unit diagonal results
      in only the strictly lower or upper triangle of the matrix being modified.

    Removed some calls to setv() in test modules.
    
    Details:
    - Removed calls to setv() in test modules whose sole purpose was to
      initialize vectors to zero to ensure that nan's and inf's would not
      taint the computation. Now that beta == zero semantics have been
      updated to clear the output operand (when beta is zero), rather than
      multiply against it, these setv() calls are no longer needed.

    Properly implemented beta == 0 semantics.
    
    Details:
    - Changed name of set0 and set0_mxn macros to set0s and set0s_mxn,
      respectively.
    - Added code to the following operations that sets the output operand to
      zero if the corresponding scalar is zero (rather than performing the
      floating-point multiply, or in the case of setv, copying the value).
      This will prevent nan's and inf's from creeping into results from
      uninitialized memory.

    Fixed stale interface to packm_unb_var1().

    - Removed the control tree from the interface to packm_unb_var1(), which
      I meant to do when it was un-deprecated.

    Un-deprecated packm_unb_var1.c (needed by l2 ops).
    
    Details:
    - Added bl2_packm_unb_var1() back into the mix once I realized that level-2
      operations still need this routine for packing matrices. Now, whether
      level-2 operations should be packing matrices to begin with is another
      matter. But this fixes the segmentation fault one would have gotten when
      running bl2_gemv() on a general stride matrix.

    Removed cntl tree usage from packm implementation.
    
    Details:
    - Added new fields to obj_t info field:
      - invert_diag
      - pack_order_if_upper
      - pack_order_if_lower
      These fields allow packm_init() to embed information that begins
      in the control tree into the object so that the packm implementation
      does not need to use control trees at all. This is being done to aid
      Bryan's DxT code generation.
    - Added macros that operate on above fields.
    - Changed packm_init(), packm_blk_var2(), and packm_blk_var3() according
      to above changes.
    - Made similar (but much simpler) changes to packv.
    - Deprecated packm_blk_var1(), packm_unb_var1(), and packm_densify().
      These were part of prototype implementations and are no longer needed.

Date:   Mon Feb 11 13:20:44 2013 -0600

    Added unified test suite, and many fixes.
    
    Details:
    - Added a highly configurable, unified test suite.
    
    - Removed DUPB configuration constant from bl2_kernel.h and macro-kernel
      header files. Now, instead, DUPB is computed as (NDUP != 1) within each
      macro-kernel. This fixes a bug in trmm/trsm whereby bp was indexed into
      incorrectly when DUPB was set to FALSE but the NDUP was still non-unit.
      By encoding both pieces of information into one constant in _kernel.h,
      it seems somewhat less likely others will encounter this bug in the
      future.
    - Added level-2 cache blocksizes to _kernel.h for reference configuration,
      and defined blocksizes in _cntl.c files to these default values.
    
    - Changed semantics of her2k and syr2k such that these operations no longer
      expect the B matrix to already be conjugate-transposed (or just transposed
      for syr2k). However, these semantics are preserved for the internal
      mechanics of the implementations, including the internal back-end and all
      blocked variants.
    - Inserted checks for real-valued alpha and beta for herk/her2k and herk,
      respectively.
    
    - Relaxed general object structure constraints in _basic_check() for gemv, ger.
    - Changed her front-end to NOT copy-cast to real projection; instead, this is
      replaced by selecting either the real part or both parts within the unblocked
      algorithm implementation, depending on the value of conjh.
    - Added conjh to all _check routines for her so that the code knows when to
      verify that alpha has an imaginary component equal to zero (for her, but
      not syr).
    - Changed control tree for her to forgo packing.
    
    - Added unit diagonal support to fnormm.
    - Redefined real versions of abval2s macros in terms of fabs(), fabsf().
    - Redefined complex versions of sqrt2s macros using the actual "complex square
      root" formula.
    - Created new level-0 object-based routines, suffixed with "sc" (for "scalar").
    - Defined new level-1v, -1d, and -1m versions of add and sub operations
      (two-operand add and subtract).
    - Added new scalar macros:
      - getris: acquire real and imaginary components.
      - setris: set real and imaginary components.
      - addjs: addition with conjugated x.
      - subjs: subtraction with conjugated x.
    - Defined new utility operations:
      - absumv: element-wise sum of absolute values for vector elements.
      - absumm: element-wise sum of absolute values for matrix elements.
      - mkherm: convert existing matrix to Hermitian.
      - mksymm: convert existing matrix to symmetric.
      - mktrim: convert existing matrix to triangular.
    
    - Added various error checking routines.
    - Added bl2_clock_min_diff(), which is used to more cleanly measure the
      wall clock time of a code block.
    - Added general stride support to bl2_obj_alloc_buffer().
    - Added bl2_obj_init_scalar().
    - Updated parameter mapping in bl2_param_map.c.
    - Added support for queriable version string.
    
    - Fixed a bug in the her2k macro-kernels (which currently are simply
      implemented in terms of two invocations of herk) whereby beta was being
      applied to both the first and second rank-k updates, rather than only
      the first.
    - Fixed a bug in trmm/trsm whereby transpose and right side cases were not
      properly implemented due to erroneous assumptions regarding aliasing and
      root objects.
    - Fixed a bug in the upper triangular trsm macro-kernel in which the wrong
      MR x NR block of B was being updated.
    - Fixed a bug in the inverts macro in the double real case whereby the
      value was typecast to float before inversion. This affected non-unit cases
      of dtrsm.
    - Fixed a bug in the reference kernels for gemmtrsm whereby the minus one
      constant was being applied incorrectly.
    - Fixed a bug in the overall treatment of non-unit alpha for trsm. The code
      now mimics the rank-k strategy of gemm, whereby alpah is applied during
      the first iteration of variant 3, with BLIS_ONE passed in instead for
      subsequent iterations. This also required passing alpha into the macro-
      kernels as well as the fused gemmtrsm micro-kernels.
    - Fixed a bug in trsm_u_blk_var1 whereby the gemm macro-kernel was being
      called for blocks strictly above the diagonal. While this sounds good in
      theory, this cannot be done because gemm_ker_var2 expects row panels of
      A to be packed from top to bottom, while for trsm_u, A is actually packed
      from bottom to top due to the reverse (BR->TL) nature of the algorithm.
    - Fixed a bug in packm_cxk() whereby panel packings with unit panel
      dimensions were mishandled due to incorrect arguments to the copyv kernel.
      Also changed the copyv kernel invocation to scal2v so that these edge
      cases are properly handled when scaling is requested.
    - Fixed a bug in packv_int() whereby an uninitialized object is passed in
      instead of the source object.
    - Fixed a bug whereby level-2 code could allocate memory dynamically via
      bl2_malloc() and then attempt to free it via bl2_mm_release(). Also fixed
      a potential future bug whereby a mem_t object that is actually no longer
      "allocated" from the static pool is mistaken for being allocated due to
      failure to NULLify the buffer when the block was most recently released.
    - Fixed a bug in bl2_acquire_mpart_*() whreby the uplo field was mistakenly
      toggled when the requested subpartition needed to be "reflected" due to it
      residing in an unstored region.

    Defined Frobenius norm operations.
    
    Details:
    - Added level-0 grabis macro operation to grab imaginary component of one
      variable and copy it to the real component of another variable.
    - Defined sumsqv operation, which computes the sum of the absolute squares
      of the elements of a vector. This implementation is modeled after ?lassq
      in netlib LAPACK.
    - Defined fnormv and fnormm operations, which compute the Frobenius norm on
      vectors and matrices, respectively. These operations are treated as one-
      operand operations where the output norm value is the real projection of
      the datatype of the input operand. Both operations are implemented in terms
      of sumsqv.

    - Fixed some inconsistent usage of n_iter_max and n_iter in the two
      bl2_set_dims_incs_uplo_[12]m macros. The right thing ended up happening
      despite the bug, which is why I had not discovered it until now.

    Renamed x86,x86_64 kernels to indicate 'd' fusing.
    
    Details:
    - Renamed x86 and x86_64 kernels to contain a 'd' before the fusing shape
      to emphasize that the fusing shape is not for all datatype instances, but
      rather just for one (that of double-precision real). Other fusing shapes
      would be proportional to their precision and domain "byte footprints".
    - Corresponding changes to config/clarksville/bl2_kernel.h.

    More tweaks to _config.h, _kernel.h; smem tweaks.
    
    Details:
    - Moved kernel-related definitions form bl2_config.h to bl2_kernel.h.
    - Replaced #define of _GNU_SOURCE with #define of _POSIX_C_SOURCE. This
      accomplishes the same thing (enabling posix_memalign()) without enabling
      all of the GNU extensions we don't need.
    - Defined the size of the static memory pool in terms of MC, KC, and NC,
      as well as two new constants that determine how many MCxKC blocks and
      how many KCxNC blocks should be allocated (defined in bl2_config.h).
    - In the case of static memory pool exhaustion, replaced the generic
      bl2_abort() with a specific error code call.

    Fixed bug in reference gemm ukernels.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug whereby, for the reference gemm ukernels, the matrix product
      was not correctly accumulated and scaled (by alpha) into the output matrix
      C. (Thanks to Fran for finding this bug.)
    - Whitespace changes to reference trsm kernels.

    Expanded reference packm/unpackm kernel set to 16.
    
    Details:
    - Added 10xk, 12xk, 14xk, and 16xk reference kernels for packm and
      unpackm.
    - Updated bl2_[un]packm_cxk() to silently use scal2m if "out of range"
      kernel size is requested. (Thanks to Tyler for finding this bug.)
    - Updated bl2_kernel.h to contain new _KERNEL definitions, according
      to above changes, for 'reference' and 'clarksville' configurations.
    - Updated CHANGELOG.
    - Removed "output*.m" from .gitignore.

    Added auto-detection of version string (via git).
    
    Details:
    - Added build/update-version-file.sh script for auto-detecting "version"
      string and updating 'version' file accordingly. (If .git directory is
      not present, then it is assumed this copy of BLIS is a downloaded
      release, in which case 'version' file is left unchanged.)
    - Added invocation of update-version-file.sh to configure script.
