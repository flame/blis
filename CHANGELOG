    Factored common code from blocksize functions.
    
    Details:
    - Split bli_determine_blocksize_[fb]() into two functions each, the
      newer ones ending with the _sub suffix. These new sub-functions are
      now called from bli_[gemm|trmm|trsm]_determine_kc_[fb](), which
      eliminates redundant code and will allow any future tweaks to the
      core sub-functions to automatically be inherited by the operation-
      specific versions.

    Extended newly relaxed KC to hemm, symm.
    
    Details:
    - These changes were intended for the previous commit.
    - Defined bli_gemm_determine_kc_[fb]() and bli_gemm_determine_kc_[fb](),
      which determine blocksizes for gemm-based operations, taking special
      care to "nudge" the kc dimension up to a multiple of MR or NR for
      hemm and symm operations, as needed.
    - Changed bli_gemm_blk_var3f.c to call bli_gemm_determine_kc_f().
      instead of bli_determine_blocksize_f().
    - Comment updates to bli_trmm_blocksize.c, bli_trsm_blocksize.c.

Author: Field G. Van Zee <field@cs.utexas.edu>
Date:   Wed Oct 22 17:21:58 2014 -0500

    Relaxed constraint that KC be multiple of MR, NR.
    
    Details:
    - Relaxed a long-held requirement in register blocksizes that required
      the kernel programmer to choose a KC that was divisible by both MR
      and NR. This was very constraining on some architectures that did not
      use register blocksizes that were powers of two. The constraint is
      now enforced only for trmm and trsm, where it is needed, and it is
      now handled by "nudging" kc upward at runtime, if necessary, to be a
      multiple of MR or NR, as needed.
    - Defined bli_trmm_determine_kc_[fb]() and bli_trsm_determine_kc_[fb](),
      which determine blocksizes for trmm and trsm, taking special care to
      "nudge" the kc dimension up to a multiple of MR or NR, as needed.
    - Changed bli_trmm_blk_var3[fb].c to call bli_trmm_determine_kc_[fb]()
      instead of bli_determine_blocksize_[fb]().
    - Added safeguard to bli_align_dim_to_mult() that returns the dimension
      unmodified if the dimension multiple is zero (to avoid division by
      zero).
    - Removed cpp guard/check for KC % MR == 0 and KC % NR == 0 from
      bli_kernel_macro_defs.h.
    - Whitespace, variable name changes to bli_blocksize.c.
    - Removed old commented code from bli_gemm_cntl.c.

commit e64dba5633fc49b768b5edc7762f2b5d8a4d0588
Author: Field G. Van Zee <field@cs.utexas.edu>
Date:   Mon Oct 20 19:23:06 2014 -0500

    Re-implemented micro-panel alignment.
    
    Details:
    - This commit re-implements a feature that was removed in commit
      c2b2ab62. It was removed because, at the time, I wasn't sure how the
      micro-panel alignment feature would interact with the 4m method (when
      applied at the micro-kernrel level), and so it seemed safer to disable
      the feature entirely rather than allow possible breakage. This commit
      revisits the issue and safely re-implements the feature in a way that
      is compatible with 4m, 3m, 4mh, and 3mh (and native execution).
    - Modified the static memory pool to account for micro-panel alignment
      space.
    - Modified packm_init and blocked variants to align whole micro-panels
      by a datatype-specific alignment value that may be set by the
      configuration. (If it is not set by the configuration, it will default
      to BLIS_SIZEOF_?.)
    - Modified macro-kernels so that:
      - storage stride is handled properly given the new micro-panel
        alignment behavior;
      - indexing through 3m/4m/rih-type sub-panels, as is done by trmm and
        trsm, is more robust (e.g. will work if the applicable packing
        register blocksize is odd);
      - imaginary strides are computed and stored within auxinfo_t structs,
        which allows the virtual micro-kernels to more easily determine how
        to index into the micro-panel operands.
    - Modified virtual 3m and 4m micro-kernels to use the imaginary strides
      within the auxinfo_t structs instead of panel strides.
    - Deprecated the panel stride fields from the auxinfo_t structs.
    - Updated test suite to print out the micro-panel alignment values.

      as well as assembly-based and OpenBLAS implementations of gemm
      in single and multithreaded modes.

    Use correct definition of bli_is_last_iter().
    
    Details:
    - As intended for previous commit, the new definition of
      bli_is_last_iter() is now disabled in favor of the old
      definition.

Author: Field G. Van Zee <field@cs.utexas.edu>
Date:   Fri Oct 17 11:19:34 2014 -0500

    Minor changes and fixes.
    
    Details:
    - Redefined bli_is_last_iter() to take thread_id and num_thread
      arguments, which allows the macro to correctly compute whether a
      given iteration is the last that the thread will compute in that
      particular loop. The new definition, however, remains disabled
      (commented out) until someone can look at this more closely, as
      the new definition seems to actually hurt performance slightly.
    - Whitespace and related updates to level-3 macro-kernels.
    - Updated test suite so that performance results in the hundreds of
      gigaflops does not disrupt the column alignment of the output.

    Fixed two minor bugs.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in the test suite for the trsm_ukr and gemmtrsm_ukr test
      modules whereby the uplo bits of some packed matrix objects were not
      being set properly, resulting in false FAILURE results for those
      tests. Thanks to Tyler Smith for bringing this issue to my attention.
    - Fixed a bug in bli_obj_alloc_buffer() that caused an unnecessary
      "not yet implemented" abort() when creating a 1x1 object with non-unit
      strides.

    Fixed a bug in the pack schema-related bit macros.
    
    Details:
    - Expanded the BLIS_PACK_SCHEMA_BITS value in bli_type_defs.h to
      include all six bits presently used in the pack schema bitfield of
      the info field of obj_t structs. Prior to this commit, the macro
      constant only included the lowest five bits, which excluded the
      "is or is not packed" bit. This manifested as a strange bug in
      probably many level-2 codes that invoked packing, though we only
      observed it in ger before fixing. Thanks to Devin Matthews for
      finding and reporting this bug.

    Details:
    - We actually need to check alignment of lda*sizeof(double) and NOT

      still allow the optimized code to run when it shouldn't. Thanks
      to Devin for pointing this out.

    Details:
    - The bugfix in a68b316c was inadvertantly checkin alignment of the
      leading dimension itself, rather than the byte size of the leading
      dimension. Now, we simply check alignment of a+lda.

    Added high-level implementations of 4m, 3m.
    
    Details:
    - Added "4mh" and "3mh" APIs, which implement the 4m and 3m methods at
      high levels, respectively. APIs for trmm and trsm were NOT added due
      to the fact that these approaches are inherently incompatible with
      implementing 4m or 3m at high levels (because the input right-hand
      side matrix is overwritten).
    - Added 4mh, 3mh virtual micro-kernels, and updated the existing 4m and
      3m so that all are stylistically consistent.
    - Added new "rih" packing kernels (both low-level and structure-aware)
      to support both 4mh and 3mh.
    - Defined new pack_t schemas to support real-only, imaginary-only, and
      real+imaginary packing formats.
    - Added various level0 scalar macros to support the rih packm kernels.
    - Minor tweaks to trmm macro-kernels to facilitate 4mh and 3mh.
    - Added the ability to enable/disable 4mh, 3m, and 3mh, and adjusted
      level-3 front-ends to check enabledness of 3mh, 3m, 4mh, and 4m (in
      that order) and execute the first one that is enabled, or the native
      implementation if none are enabled.
    - Added implementation query functions for each level-3 operation so
      that the user can query a string that describes the implementation
      that is currently enabled.
    - Updated test suite to output implementation types for reach level-3
      operation, as well as micro-kernel types for each of the five micro-
      kernels.
    - Renamed BLIS_ENABLE_?COMPLEX_VIA_4M macros to _ENABLE_VIRTUAL_?COMPLEX.
    - Fixed an obscure bug when packing Hermitian matrices (regular packing
      type) whereby the diagonal elements of the packed micro-panels could
      get tainted if the source matrix's imaginary diagonal part contained
      garbage.

    Pass pack_t schemas into ukernels via auxinfo_t.
    
    Details:
    - Modified macro-kernels to pass the pack_t schema values for matrices
      A and B into the datatype-specific functions, where they are now
      inserted into a newly-expanded auxinfo_t struct. This gives gives the
      micro-kernels access to the pack_t schema values embedded in the
      control trees, which determine the precise format into which the
      matrix elements are packed.
    - Updated a call to bli_packm_init_pack() in src/test_libblis.c to
      remove densify argument. Meant to include this in commit c472993b.

    Removed densify argument to packm_cntl_obj_create().
    
    Details:
    - Removed the "densify" bool_t argument to bli_packm_cntl_obj_create().
      This argument was inserted very early in BLIS's development, when it
      was anticipated that the developer may sometimes wish to pack a
      Hermitian, symmetric, or triangular matrix without making it dense.
      But as it turns out, if we are packing a matrix, we always want to
      make it dense in some way or another due to the fact that the micro-
      kernel only multiplies dense micro-panels. Thus, unless/until there
      is a real need for the feature, it seems reasonable to remove it from
      the packm_cntl API.

    Retired trmm_t control tree definitions, usage.
    
    Details:
    - Replaced all trmm_t control tree instances and usage with that of
      gemm_t. This change is similar to the recent retirement of the herk_t
      control tree.
    - Tweaked packm blocked variants so that the triangular code does NOT
      assume that k is a multiple of MR (when A is triangular) or NR (when
      B is triangular). This means that bottom-right micro-panels packed for
      trmm will have different zero-padding when k is not already a multiple
      of the relevant register blocksize. While this creates a seemingly
      arbitrary and unnecessary distinction between trmm and trsm packing,
      it actually allows trmm to be handled with one control tree, instead
      of one for left and one for right side cases. Furthermore, since only
      one tree is required, it can now be handled by the gemm tree, and thus
      the trmm control tree definitions can be disposed of entirely.
    - Tweaked trmm macro-kernels so that they do NOT inflate k up to a
      multiple of MR (when A is triangular) or NR (when B is triangular).
    - Misc. tweaks and cleanups to bli_packm_struc_cxk_4m.c and _3m.c, some
      of which are to facilitate above-mentioned changes whereby k is no
      longer required to be a multiple of register blocksize when packing
      triangular micro-panels.
    - Adjusted trmm3 according to above changes.
    - Retired trmm_t control tree creation/initialization functions.

    Retired herk_t control tree definitions, usage.
    
    Details:
    - Replaced all herk_t control tree instances and usage with that of
      gemm_t, since the two types presently have the same fields. This means
      that herk, her2k, syrk, and syr2k can simply use the gemm control tree
      as-is, just as hemm and symm have been doing for some time now.
    - Retired herk_t control tree creation/initialization functions.
    - Retired many _target.c and .h files into 'old' directories.

    Minor code cleanup to bli_packm_struc_cxk*.c
    
    Details:
    - Realized that we don't need to track rs_p11 and cs_p11 for
      Hermitian/symmetric case of bli_packm_struc_cxk*(). They are always
      equal to rs_p and cs_p.

    Minor update to packm_cxk kernels.
    
    Details:
    - Changed m and n dimension parameter names to panel_dim and panel_len,
      respectively, in packm_cxk, packm_cxk_3m, packm_cxk_4m kernel wrapper
      functions. This makes the code a little easier to read since "m" and
      "n" have connotations that are not applicable here.
    - Comment updates.

    Retired portions of bli_kernel_3m/4m_macro_defs.h.
    
    Details:
    - Removed sections of bli_kernel_[4m|3m]_macro_defs.h that defined
      4m/3m-specific blocksizes after realizing that this can be done in
      bli_gemm[4m|3m]_cntl.c, since that is (mostly) the only place they
      are used.
    - The maximum cache values for 4m/3m are stll needed when computing mem
      pool dimensions in bli_mem_pool_macro_defs.h. As a workaround, "local"
      definitions in terms of the regular cache blocksizes are now in place.
    - Similarly, the register blocksizes for 4m/3m are still needed in
      bli_kernel_post_macro_defs.h. As a workaround, "local" definitions in
      terms of the regular register blocksizes are now in place.

    Changed semantics of blocksize extensions.
    
    Details:
    - Changed semantics of cache and register blocksize extensions so that
      the extended values are tracked, rather than just the marginal
      extensions.
    - BLIS_EXTEND_[MKN]C_? has been renamed BLIS_MAXIMUM_[MKN]C_?.
    - BLIS_EXTEND_[MKN]R_? has been renamed BLIS_PACKDIM_[MKN]R_?.
    - bli_blksz_ext_*() APIs have been renamed to bli_blksz_max_*(). Note
      that these "max" query routines grab the maximum value for cache
      blocksizes and the packdim value for register blocksizes.
    - bli_info_*() API has been updated accordingly.
    - All configurations have been updated accordingly.

    Pass pack schema into packm_struc_cxk*().
    
    Details:
    - Changed the interface to the packm_struc_cxk*() kernels to include
      the pack_t schema. This allows the implementation to more easily
      determine how the micro-panel is stored (row-stored column panel
      or column-stored row panel).
    - Updated packm blocked variants to pass in the schema.
    - Updated packm_ker_t function pointer definition accordingly.

    Reorganized packm implementation.
    
    Details:
    - Reorganized packm variants and structure-aware kernels so that all
      routines for a given pack format (4m, 3m, regular) reside in a single
      file.
    - Renamed _blk_var4 to _blk_var2 and generalized so that it will work
      for
      both 4m and 3m, and adjusted 4m/3m _cntl_init() functions accordingly.
    - Added a new packm_ker_t function pointer type to
      bli_kernel_type_defs.h
      to facilitate function pointer typecasting in the datatype-specific
      packm_blk_var2() functions.
    - Deprecated _blk_var3.
    - Fixed a bug in the triangular micro-panel packing facility that
      affected trmm and trmm3 with unit diagonals.

    - Renamed bli_eqri.h (and macros within) to end with 'ris' suffix.

      micro-panel packing that is too large for an existing packm ukernel.
    - Comment updates.

    - Rather than passing the packm blocked routines a boolean value that
      represents whether the matrix is being packed to row or column storage,
      we now pass in the pack schema itself.

    Renamed packm scalar from beta to kappa.
    
    Details:
    - The packm implementation (i.e. sources files in frame/1m/packm and
      frame/1m/packm/ukernels), interchangeably used the names "beta" and
      "kappa" to refer to the optional scalar to be applied during packing.
      This commit renames all uses of "beta" to be "kappa", since "beta"
      sometimes evokes the scalar specifically on the output matrix of a
      level-2 or level-3 operation.

    Details:
    - Added extra spaces to align arguments of
      bli_obj_scalar_init_detached_copy_of(). This misalignment was due to
      the fact that the function was previously named
      bli_obj_init_scalar_copy_of() and the name change, performed in
      b444489f, was done via recursive sed commands which left subsequent
      lines untouched.

    Details:
    - Combined the 4m/3m bits into an expanded bitfield, which will encode
      the packing "format" of the micro-panels. This will allow for more
      easily and compactly encoding additional formats.
    - Other minor comment/whitespace updates to bli_type_defs.h.

    Cleaned up front-end layering for 4m/3m.
    
    Details:
    - Added an extra layer to level-3 front-ends (examples: bli_gemm_entry()
      and bli_gemm4m_entry()) to hide the control trees from the code that
      decides whether to execute native or 4m-based implementations. The
      layering was also applied to 3m.
    - Branch to 4m code based on the return value of bli_4m_is_enabled(),
      rather than the cpp macros BLIS_ENABLE_?COMPLEX_VIA_4M. This lays
      the groundwork for users to be able to change at runtime which
      implementation is called by the main front-ends (e.g. bli_gemm()).
    - Retired some experimental gemm code that hadn't been touched in
      months.

    Added bli_4m API for querying 4m enabled state.
    
    Details:
    - Added bli_4m.c (and header), which defines a simple API that can be
      used to query, enable, and disable 4m-based complex support in BLIS.
      The macros BLIS_ENABLE_?COMPLEX_VIA_4M are now used to initialize
      the variable that determines the state (enabled or disabled).
    - Changed bli_info*() API so that all cache and register blocksize-
      related query routines return the blksz_t objects' values as they
      exist at runtime, rather than return the values as determined by the
      configuration system (e.g. bli_kernel.h, or defaults for those values
      not specified). This sets the foundation for being able to change
      those blocksizes at runtime.

    Added optional row preference to ukernel config.
    
    Details:
    - Added the ability for the kernel developer to indicate the gemm micro-
      kernel as having a preference for accessing the micro-tile of C via
      contiguous rows (as opposed to contiguous columns). This property may
      be encoded in bli_kernel.h as BLIS_?GEMM_UKERNEL_PREFERS_CONTIG_ROWS,
      which may be defined or left undefined. Leaving it undefined leads to
      the default assumption of column preference.
    - Changed conditionals in frame/3/*/*_front.c that induce transposition
      of the operation so that the transposition is induced only if there
      is disagreement between the storage of C and the preference of the
      micro-kernel. Previously, the only conditional that needed to be met
      was that C was row-stored, which is to say that we assumed the micro-
      kernel preferred column-contiguous access on C.
    - Added a "prefers_contig_rows" property to func_t objects, and updated
      calls to bli_func_obj_create() in _cntl.c files in order to support
      the above changes.
    - Removed the row-storage optimization from bli_trsm_front.c because
      it is actually ineffective. This is because the right-side case of
      trsm flips the A and B micro-panel operands (since BLIS only requires
      left-side gemmtrsm/trsm kernels), meaning any transposition done
      at the high level is then undone at the low level.
    - Tweaked trmm, trmm3 _front.c files to eliminate a possible redundant
      invocation of the bli_obj_swap() macro.

    Reorganized packm ukernels.
    
    Details:
    - Previously, packm micro-kernels were organized by the implied register
      blocksize (panel dimension) assumed by the kernel, meaning conventional,
      ri, and ri3 variations of some micro-kernel size were housed in the same
      file. This commit reorganizes the micro-kernels so that all sizes reside
      in the same file for each format type (conventional, ri, and ri3).

    Tweaks to gemm4m, gemm3m virtual ukernels.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a potential, but as-yet unobserved bug in gemm3m that would
      allow undesirable inf/NaN propogation, since C was being scaled by
      beta even if it was equal to zero.
    - In gemm3m micro-kernel, we now avoid copying C to the temporary
      micro-tile if beta is zero.
    - Rearranged computation in gemm4m so that the temporary C micro-tile
      is accessed less, and C is accessed only after the micro-kernel
      calls. This improves performance marginally in most situations.
    - Comment updates to both gemm4m and gemm3m micro-kernels.

    Details:
    - Rolled back recent changes to bli_obj_is_row_stored() and
      bli_obj_is_col_stored() so that those macros now only inspect the
      strides (row or column). It turns out that the more sophisticated
      definitions introduced in a51e32e are not necessary, because these
      "obj" macros are virtually never used on packed matrices, and when
      they are, they can use bli_obj_is_[row|col}_packed() macros, which
      inspect the info bitfield.

    Minor edits to configurations' make_defs.mk files.
    
    Details:
    - Redefined CFLAGS, CFLAGS_NOOPT, and CFLAGS_KERNELS so that CFLAGS_NOOPT
      is defined first and then the other two are defined in terms of
      CFLAGS_NOOPT. This textually cleans up the definitions and makes them a
      little easier to read.

    Added CBLAS compatibility layer.
    
    Details:
    - Added a new section in bli_config.h files of all configurations for
      enabling CBLAS support. (Currently, the default is for the CBLAS layer
      to be disabled.)
    - Added a directory, frame/compat/cblas, to house CBLAS source code. A
      subdirectory 'f77_sub' holds subroutine wrappers corresponding to
      subroutines found in CBLAS that allow calling some BLAS routines with
      the return value passed as the last argument rather than as an actual
      (function) return value. This was probably intended to allow CBLAS to
      avoid the whole f2c debacle altogether. However, since BLIS does not
      assume the presence of a Fortran compiler, we had to provide similar
      routines in C.
    - A script, integrate-cblas-tarball.sh, is included to streamline the
      integration of future revisions of the CBLAS source code.
    - The current tarball, cblas.tgz, that was used with the above script to
      generate the present set of CBLAS source code is also included.
    - Updated blis.h to include necessary CBLAS-related headers.

    Fix permissions error installing to non-owned directory

commit db97ce979b88c051922c2f946ce52d523c7a12c6
Author: Kevin Locke <kevin@kevinlocke.name>
Date:   Sun Aug 3 12:48:04 2014 -0600

    Fix permissions error installing to non-owned directory
    
    When installing to a directory which is not owned by the installing
    user, even when the user has write permission for the directory, the
    installation can fail with an error similar to the following:
    
    Installing libblis-0.1.4-7-sandybridge.a into /usr/local/lib/
    install: cannot change permissions of ‘/usr/local/lib’: Operation not permitted
    Makefile:658: recipe for target '/usr/local/lib/libblis-0.1.4-7-sandybridge.a' failed
    make: *** [/usr/local/lib/libblis-0.1.4-7-sandybridge.a] Error 1
    
    In the example case, the error occurred because the user attempted to
    install to /usr/local and /usr/local/lib is owned by root with mode 2755
    which the Makefile unsuccessfully attempted to change to 0755.
    
    Given that installing to /usr/local is likely to be quite common and the
    ownership/permissions are the default for Debian and Debian-derived
    Linux distributions (perhaps others as well), this commit attempts to
    support that use case by using mkdir rather than install to create the
    directory (which is the same approach as Automake).

    Redefined bit field macros with bitshift operator.
    
    Details:
    - Redefined many of the macros that define bit fields and bit values in
      the obj_t info field using the bitshift operator (<<). This makes it
      easier to reorder bit fields, or expand existing bit fields, or add
      new fields. The bitshifting should be evaluated by the compiler at
      compile-time.

    Reimplemented unit blocksize fix in prev commit.
    
    Details:
    - Instead of inferring the storage format of the micro-panels from within
      the packm variants, we now pass in a bool_t value that denotes whether
      the packed matrix contains row-stored column panels or column-stored
      row panels. This value can then be tested more easily inside the main
      packm variant loop.
    - Renumbered pack_t schema values in bli_type_defs.h so that there are
      now five bits, each with different meaning:
      - 4: packed or not packed?
      - 3: packed for 3m?
      - 2: packed for 4m?
      - 1: packed to panels?
      - 0: stored by rows or columns?
    - Added new macros that test for status of above bits in schema bit
      subfield, and renamed some existing macros related to 4m/3m.

    Fixed unit register blocksize brokenness.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a breakdown in BLIS's ability to differentiate between row-stored
      and column-stored micro-panels when MR or NR is unit. When either
      register blocksize (or both) is equal to one, inspecting the strides of
      the affected packed micro-panel is no longer sufficient to determine
      whether the micro-panel is a row-stored column panel or a column-stored
      row panel (because both strides are unit). At that point, dimension
      information is necessary when invoking the bli_is_row_stored_f() and
      bli_is_col_stored_f() macros (and their "obj" counterparts). Thanks to
      Ilya Polkovnichenko for reporting this bug.
    - Added panel dimensions (m and n) to obj_t, which are set in
      packm_init() and then passed into the blocked variants to support the
      aforementioned update.

    Tweaked behavior of herk, her2k for BLAS compat.
    
    Details:
    - Updated herk_front() and her2k_front() to explicitly set the imaginary
      components of the diagonal entries of C to zero after the computation
      is complete. This is needed in case downstream applications read the
      full diagonal entries (i.e., including imaginary part), which could, in
      the absence of this modification, accumulate numerical error from
      subsequent rank-k/rank-2k updates.
    - Updated BLAS compatibility wrappers for herk and her2k to return early
      if:
        n == 0 || ( ( alpha == 0 || k == 0 ) && beta == 1 )
      This also results in the imaginary components of diagonal entries NOT
      being set to zero (see above), which is consistent with BLAS.
    - Updated mkherm to use setid instead of an inlined loop over the
      diagonal.

    Details:
    - Defined a new level-1d operation, setid, which sets the imaginary
      elements of an object's diagonal to a single scalar. This can be
      useful, for example, when trying to make the diagonal of a Hermitian
      matrix real-valued.

    Changed order of zero dim / error checking.
    
    Details:
    - Updated level-2 and level-3 internal back-ends so that the operation's
      _check() function is called BEFORE any attempt to return early due to
      the presence of zero dimensions. This ordering makes more sense because
      (for example) object dimensions should match even if one of them is
      zero. Previously, a dimension mismatch could result in an early return
      with no error message.
    - Updated bli_check_object_buffer() so that NULL buffers result in an
      error only if the object is dimensionally non-empty (i.e., only if both
      of the object's dimensions are non-zero). This allows BLIS operations
      to be performed on dimensionally empty objects (i.e., where at least one
      dimension is zero).
    - Updated the error message associated with bli_check_object_buffer()
      to mention the newly relaxed constraint mentioned above, vis-a-vis
      non-zero dimensions.

    Inserted gemv beta-scaling bug into compat layer.
    
    Details:
    - BLAS has a peculiar bug (or feature) whereby calling gemv on a vector
      y of non-zero length and a vector x of zero length results in no action.
      Given that the operation is y := beta*y + A*x, many (most?) individuals
      would expect vector y to still be scaled by beta. BLIS, when called
      natively, handles these cases intuitively (with beta scaling).
      Unfortunately, many BLAS test suites actually check for the way this
      situation is handled. Therefore, we have decided to implement this "bug"
      in the compatibility layer so as to provide "bug-for-bug" compatibility
      with BLAS.

    Added bli_info_*() query functions.
    
    Details:
    - Added a new API family, bli_info_*(), which can be used to query
      information about how BLIS was configured. Most of these values are
      returned as gint_t, with the exception of the version string which
      is char*.
    - Changed how the testsuite driver queries information about how BLIS
      was configured (from using macro constants directly to using the
      new bli_info API).
    - Removed bli_version.c and its header file.
    - Added STRINGIFY_INT() macro to bli_macro_defs.h
    - Renamed info_t type in bli_type_defs.h to objbits_t (not because of
      an actual naming conflict, but because the name 'info_t' would now be
      somewhat misleading in the presence of the new bli_info API, as the
      two are unrelated).

      any possible infs or NaNs in the output matrix, if it happens to be
      uninitialized. Thanks to Tony Kelman for isolating this bug.

    Defined _ukernel_void() wrappers to micro-kernels.
    
    Details:
    - Added wrappers for micro-kernels so that users may invoke the
      micro-kernels without knowing what the function names actually are.
      This is useful when an application wishes to call the micro-kernel
      from a shared library instance of BLIS, where the application may not
      necessarily have the luxury of grabbing the micro-kernel name(s) from
      C preprocessor macros at compile-time. Also, since the wrappers use
      void* pointers, one's environment does not need to be aware of some
      BLIS types such as scomplex and dcomplex. These wrappers now join the
      level-1 and level-1f kernel wrappers, which pre-dated this commit.
    - Removed the wrapper definitions and prototypes from the micro-kernel
      test suite modules, and replaced calls to them with calls to the new
      wrappers mentioned above.

    Quick and dirty multithreading for TRSM
    
    Should work fine for small number of threads (up to 8 or maybe even 16).
    However, performance is yet untested.
    This parallelizes the "JR" loop for the left sided cases
    and the "IR" loop for the right sided cases.
    
    Future work is to parallelize the outer loops as well.

    Added shared library support to build system.
    
    Details:
    - Modified top-level Makefile to support building shared (dynamic)
      libraries.
    - Updated most configurations' make_defs.mk files to include necessary
      compiler/linker flags needed by top-level Makefile.
    - Note that by default, all configurations presently do NOT build
      shared libraries. To enable, one must change the value of
      BLIS_ENABLE_DYNAMIC_BUILD to 'yes'.

    Fixed ldim alignment bug in core2 gemm ukernel.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in the dunnington/core2 gemm micro-kernels that resulted in
      a segmentation fault if a column-stored matrix's starting address was
      aligned, but its leading dimension was such that its second column was
      unaligned. Basically, the micro-kernel was assuming that aligned load
      instructions were safe when they actually were not. An extra condition
      that checks the alignment of cs_c (ie: the leading dimension in the
      column storage case) has now been added. Thanks to Michael Lehn for
      reporting this bug.

    Changed treatment of NULL object buffers.
    
    Details:
    - Relaxed the constraint in bli_obj_attach_buffer_check(), which required
      the buffer address being attached to be non-NULL. This is acceptable
      because the user was already able to create and use objects with NULL
      buffers (via bli_obj_create_without_buffer(), which initializes the
      buffer to NULL).
    - Inserted calls to newly defined function, bli_check_object_buffer(),
      into nearly all operations' _check() or _int_check() functions. This
      allows BLIS to abort peacefully if a computational routine is called
      with an object containing a NULL buffer. By contrast, under such
      conditions, BLAS would typically fail with a segmentation fault.
    - Within operation front-ends, moved the calls to _check()/_int_check()
      so that zero dimensions are checked first (and if found, execution
      returns with trivial or no computation). This resolves issue #7. Thanks
      to Jack Poulson for reporting this bug.

    Can now query register blocksizes from blk algs.
    
    Details:
    - Added a new field to blksz_t objects that allows one to attach a
      sub-object. Doing this allows us to associate a register blocksize with
      any given cache blocksize. That way, the register blocksize can be
      queried wherever the cache blocksize would normally be accessible
      (e.g. a blocked algorithm).
    - Modified bli_gemm_cntl.c (and 4m/3m variants) so that the register
      blocksizes are attached to the cache blocksizes after they are created.

      4m/3m variants).

    Attempted to fix uninitialized variable warnings.
    
    Details:
    - Added initialization statements to various macros used in level 1m and
      1m-like operations. I wasn't able to reproduce the reported behavior,
      so hopefully this takes care of it. Thanks to Jeff Hammond for the
      report.

    Made barrier after packing implicit.
    
    This also fixed a bug where barriers in the blocked variants were inserted after the inner packing routines,
    but not the outer packing routines.
    This allowed, for instance, the block of B to not be finished being packed before computation to occur.

    Refined INSERT_GENTFUNC macro usage.
    
    Details:
    - Defined new INSERT_GENTFUNC macros so that the macro always takes
      exactly the number of arguments needed for the particular operation or
      variant being defined. Many operations were using INSERT_GENTFUNC
      macros that expected one auxiliary argument even though none were
      needed. Those instances have now been updated. Most of these instances
      were in the level-0 and -1v operations, as well as some operations
      defined in frame/util.

    Minor simplifications to trmm, trsm macro-kernels.
    
    Details:
    - Simplified some code that would have allowed the diagonal of a trmm
      or trsm triangular matrix to intersect the short end of a micro-panel.
      This is disallowed via higher-level constraints on cache blocksizes, so
      this code was never needed and only served to obfuscate.
    - Updated some comments in trmm, trsm macro-kernels.

    Reorganized norm operations.
    
    Details:
    - Completely reoganized norm operations:
      - Renames:
        - fnormsc, fnormv, fnormm -> normfsc, normfv, normfm (2-norm)
        - absumv -> norm1v (vector 1-norm)

        - normiv, normim (infinity-norm)
        - amaxv (BLAS-like absolute maximum value index)
        - asumv (BLAS-like absolute sum)
    - Deprecated absumm, as it did not correspond to any actual norm.
      (However, an inlined version now exists in the testsuite module for
      randm.)

    Minor fixes to sumsqv, abmaxv.
    
    Details:
    - Minor update to bli_sumsqv_unb_var1() to bring it up-to-date with
      LAPACK 3.5.0's zlassq.f, which, starting with 3.4.2, returns NaN when
      the vector (or matrix) contains a NaN.
    - Minor change to bli_abmaxv_unb_var1() to more closely mimic the
      behavior of netlib BLAS's izamax(). There, a "less than or equal to"
      operator is used in the search instead of "less than", which would
      change the element index returned if there were multiple maximum values.
    - Added macro function definitions for bli_isinf() and bli_isnan(), which
      are currently implemented in terms of isinf() and isnan() from math.h.

    Fixed various bugs when C99 complex is enabled.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed various bugs in packm_*_cxk(), the 4m/3m micro-kernels, and
      elsewhere in the framework that were not yet set up to work properly
      when BLIS_ENABLE_C99_COMPLEX is defined in bli_config.h
    - Extensive changes to f2c-derived files in frame/compat/f2c to allow
      C99 complex storage. Most of these changes center around accessing
      real and imaginary components via bli_?real()/bli_?imag() accessor
      macros, and setting of values via bli_?sets() assignment macros.
      (Thanks to Vladimir Sukarev for pointing out that _ENABLE_C99_COMPLEX
      was broken.)

    In packm variant 1, the variable p_begin was incremented each iteration, causing a dependency.
    This dependeny was removed, allowing each iteration to be executed in parallel.
    
    Somewhere in bli_threading.c, I was allocating an array of pointers instead of an array of structs.

commit fde5f1fdece19881f50b142e8611b772a647e6d2 (0.1.1)
Author: Field G. Van Zee <field@cs.utexas.edu>
Date:   Tue Feb 25 13:34:56 2014 -0600

    Added extensive support for configuration defaults.
    
    Details:
    - Standard names for reference kernels (levels-1v, -1f and 3) are now
      macro constants. Examples:
        BLIS_SAXPYV_KERNEL_REF
        BLIS_DDOTXF_KERNEL_REF
        BLIS_ZGEMM_UKERNEL_REF
    - Developers no longer have to name all datatype instances of a kernel
      with a common base name; [sdcz] datatype flavors of each kernel or
      micro-kernel (level-1v, -1f, or 3) may now be named independently.
      This means you can now, if you wish, encode the datatype-specific
      register blocksizes in the name of the micro-kernel functions.
    - Any datatype instances of any kernel (1v, 1f, or 3) that is left
      undefined in bli_kernel.h will default to the corresponding reference
      implementation. For example, if BLIS_DGEMM_UKERNEL is left undefined,
      it will be defined to be BLIS_DGEMM_UKERNEL_REF.
    - Developers no longer need to name level-1v/-1f kernels with multiple
      datatype chars to match the number of types the kernel WOULD take in
      a mixed type environment, as in bli_dddaxpyv_opt(). Now, one char is
      sufficient, as in bli_daxpyv_opt().
    - There is no longer a need to define an obj_t wrapper to go along with
      your level-1v/-1f kernels. The framework now prvides a _kernel()
      function which serves as the obj_t wrapper for whatever kernels are
      specified (or defaulted to) via bli_kernel.h
    - Developers no longer need to prototype their kernels, and thus no
      longer need to include any prototyping headers from within
      bli_kernel.h. The framework now generates kernel prototypes, with the
      proper type signature, based on the kernel names defined (or defaulted
      to) via bli_kernel.h.
    - If the complex datatype x (of [cz]) implementation of the gemm micro-
      kernel is left undefined by bli_kernel.h, but its same-precision real
      domain equivalent IS defined, BLIS will use a 4m-based implementation
      for the datatype x implementations of all level-3 operations, using
      only the real gemm micro-kernel.

Author: Field G. Van Zee <field@cs.utexas.edu>
Date:   Wed Feb 19 17:00:52 2014 -0600

    Added level-3 support for complex via 4m-/3m.
    
    Details:
    - Added the ability to induce complex domain level-3 operations via new
      virtual complex micro-kernels which are implemented via only real
      domain micro-kernels. Two new implementations are provided: 4m and 3m.
      4m implements complex matrix multiplication in terms of four real
      matrix multiplications, where as 3m uses only three and thus is
      capable of even higher (than peak) performance. However, the 3m method
      has somewhat weaker numerical properties, making it less desirable
      in general.
    - Further refined packing routines, which were recently revamped, and
      added packing functionality for 4m and 3m.
    - Some modifications to trmm and trsm macro-kernels to facilitate indexing
      into micro-panels which were packed for 4m/3m virtual kernels.
    - Added 4m and 3m interfaces for each level-3 operation.
    - Various other minor changes to facilitate 4m/3m methods.

    - Shifted the pack order, pack buffer type, and structure type fields
      to make room for an extra bit in the pack type/status field.

    Minor fixes to trsm consistent with prev on trmm.
    
    Details:
    - Removed use of bli_min() and bli_max() that were only being used to
      try to support situations where the diagonal would intersect the
      short end of some micro-panels, which is situation that is disallowed
      at a higher level by various constraints on the register and cache
      blocksize. This only affected trsm_ll and trsm_lu.
    - Use panel stride as passed into the macro-kernel rather than compute
      it via k and PACKMR/PACKNR. This affects all macro-kernels of trsm.

    Fixed obscure bug in trmm_ll, trmm_lu.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed an obscure bug in left-hand trmm that would only manifest when
      non-zero register blocksize extensions (PACKMR > MR or PACKNR > NR)
      are used.

    Fixed an obscure bug in packm_cxk().
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in packm_cxk() whereby the packm ukernel was being chosen
      from ldp, which is always equal to PACKMR or PACKNR. The problem with
      this is that the pack ukernels were implicitly assuming that the
      panel dimension of the panel being packed was equal to ldp, which
      is not the case when the register blocksizes extensions are non-zero
      (ie: when PACKMR > MR or PACKNR > NR, whichever is applicable). This
      problem has been fixed by passing ldp into the pack ukernels, which
      now walk through the packed micro-panel region by incrementing by this
      value, rather than incrementing by the inherent panel dimension value
      assumed by each packm ukernel (e.g. 4 in the case of packm_ref_4xk).
    - Also fixed a very minor edge case inefficiency whereby pack ukernels
      smaller than the default were not being used in edge cases, and instead
      those situations were being handled by scal2m. This is related to the
      issue above, because the pack ukernel itself was being chosen based on
      ldp instead of the panel dimension.

    Details:
    - Consolidated the functionality previously supported by packm_blk_var2()
      and packm_blk_var3() into a new variant, packm_blk_var1().
    - Updates to packm_gen_cxk(), packm_herm_cxk.c(), and packm_tri_cxk()
      to accommodate above changes.
    - Removed packm_blk_var3() and retired packm_blk_var2() to
      frame/1m/packm/old.
    - Updated all level-3 _cntl_init() functions so that the new, more
      versatile packm_blk_var1 is used for all level-3 matrix packing.

    - Revised packm_blk_var2() and _var3() by encapsulating the general,
      hermitian/symmetric, and triangular panel-packing subproblems into
      separate functions: packm_gen_cxk(), packm_herm_cxk(), and
      packm_tri_cxk(), respectively. Also, homogenized the packm code as
      well as the new specialized packm_*_cxk() code to further improve
      readability.

    Details:
    - Defined a new macro, INSERT_GENTFUNC_BASIC0, which takes only one
      argument--the base name of the function--and employed this macro
      in the reference micro-kernel files instead of the _BASIC macro,
      which takes one auxiliary argument. That argument was not being
      used and probably just acted to unnecessarily obfuscate.

    - Updated (and fixed some errors in) the "Assumptions/assertions" comment
      section of macro-kernels.
    - Changed register blocksizes of reference configuration to MR = 8 and
      NR = 4. It's always good for MR != NR in the reference configuration
      since it may help uncover bugs related to non-square micro-kernels.

    Pass panel dimensions into macro-kernels.
    
    Details:
    - Modified the interfaces to the datatype-specific macro-kernels so that:
      - pd_a and pd_b are passed in (which contain the panel dimensions of
        packed panels of a and b).
      - rs_a and cs_b are no longer passed in (they were guaranteed to be 1).
    - Modified implementations of datatype-specific macro-kernels so pd_a,
      pd_b, cs_a, and rs_b are used instead of cpp macros for MR, NR, PACKMR,
      and PACKNR, respectively.
    - Declare temporary c matrices (ct) as being maxmr-by-maxnr, which for now
      is equivalent to being mr-by-nr. maxmr and maxnr are declared in a new
      header file bli_kernel_post_macro_defs.h.

    Details:
    - Added some logic to packm_init(), pack_int() and gemm_int() so that
      (a) objects marked as BLIS_ZEROS are not packed, and (b) those
      objects are not computed with. This functionality is not currently
      needed by any existing implementations, but may be used in the
      future.

    Details:
    - Removed code that creates duplicate blksz_t objects for herk, trmm,
      and trsm. Instead, the gemm blksz_t objects are accessed via extern
      and used directly. This reduces the amount of code associated with
      each of the three _cntl_init() and _cntl_finalize() function.

    Introduced new level-3 front-end layer.
    
    Details:
    - Added new _front() functions for each level-3 operation. This is done
      so that the choosing of the control tree (and *only* the choosing of
      the control tree) happens in what was previously the "front end"
      (e.g. bli_gemm()). That control tree is then passed into the _front()
      function, which then performs up-front tasks such as parameter
      checking.

    Removed redundant hemm, her2k control trees.
    
    Details:
    - Removed code that generated a control tree specifically for hemm and
      symm. Instead, the gemm control tree is now configured so that it
      works for gemm, hemm, or symm.
    - Retired most her2k code, as it was not being used. (Currently, her2k is
      implemented as two invocations of herk.) I couldn't think of many
      situations where her2k variants were needed.
    - Removed some older her2k code.

    Embed func_t microkernel objects in control trees.
    
    Details:
    - Modified all control tree node definitions to include a new field of
      type func_t*, which is similar to a blksz_t except that it contains
      one function pointer (each typed simply as void*) for each datatype.
      We use the func_t* to embed pointers to the micro-kernels to use for
      the leaf-level nodes of each control tree. This change is a natural
      extension of control trees and will allow more flexibility in the
      future.
    - Modified all macro-kernel wrappers to obtain the micro-kernel pointers
      from the incomming (previously ignored) control tree node and then pass
      the queried pointer into the datatype-specific macro-kernel code, which
      then casts the pointer to the appropriate type (new typedefs residing
      in bli_kernel_type_defs.h) and then uses the pointer to call the micro-
      kernel. Thus, the micro-kernel function is no longer "hard-coded" (that
      is, determined when the datatype-specific macro-kernel functions are
      instantiated by the C preprocessor).
    - Added macros to bli_kernel_macro_defs.h that build datatype-specific
      base names if they do not exist already, and then uses those to build
      datatype-specific micro-kernel function names. This will allow
      developers extra flexibility if they wanted to, for example, name each
      of their datatype-specific micro-kernels differently (e.g. double
      real might be named bli_dgemm_opt_4x4() while double complex might be
      named bli_zgemm_opt_2x2()).
    - Inserted appropriate code into _cntl_init() functions that allocates
      and initializes a func_t object for the corresponding micro-kernels.
      The gemm ukernel func_t object is created once, in bli_gemm_cntl_init(),
      and then reused via extern wherever possible.

    Details:
    - Removed commented-out code from macro-kernels that was supposed to
      facilitate implementing mixed domain (complex times real) matrix
      multiplication. This functionality is still (probably possible),
      but I'm getting tired of looking at the code every time I edit
      a macro-kernel. Plus, there are probably ways of doing it at a
      higher level, via control trees.

    Removed b_aux field from cntl nodes.
    
    Details:
    - Removed b_aux field from all control tree node definitions. This field
      was being used in certain optimizations (incremental blocking) that were
      not actually being employed within BLIS, and are probably not employed
      by others.
    - Updated all _cntl_obj_create() function definitions and invocations
      according to above change.
    - Retired bli_gemm_blk_var4.c, which was one such function that employed
      incremental blocking, but which was never called by BLIS itself.

    Consolidated pack_t enums; retired VECTOR value.
    
    Details:
    - Changed the pack_t enumerations so that BLIS_PACKED_VECTOR no longer has
      its own value, and instead simply aliases to BLIS_PACKED_UNSPEC. This
      makes room in the three pack_t bits of the info field of obj_t so that
      two values are now unused, and may be used for other future purposes.
    - Updated sloppy terminology usage in comments in level-2 front-ends.
      (Replaced "is contiguous" with more accurate "has unit stride".)

    - Redirect errors to /dev/null when using 'find' to locate libraries that
      would be uninstalled upon executing "make uninstall-old". Before, if the
      Makefile was read before $(INSTALL_PREFIX)/lib existed, a "No such file
      or directory" message was emitted. This message was harmless, but is now
      suppressed in this situation.

    - In the test suite driver, inserted an explicit typecast of the return
      value of bli_getopt() prior parsing. The lack of typecast caused a

      interpreted as garbage character. Thanks to Francisco Igual for finding

    Allow building outside source distribution.
    
    Details:
    - Modified build system (mostly configure and top-level Makefile) so that
      a user can build a BLIS library outside of the top-level directory of
      the source distribution.
    - Added "test" target to Makefile so that the user can run "make test",
      which will compile, link, and run the testsuite binary. This works even
      if the build directory is externally located, thanks to the test suite
      binary's new -g and -o command-line options. Also, when creating the
      test suite via the top-level Makefile, the linking is against the
      local archive, in lib/<configname>, rather than at <install_prefix>/lib.
    - Modified testsuite/Makefile so that it links against the library built
      locally, in ../lib/<configname>.
    - Added "-lm" to LDFLAGS of most configurations' make_defs.mk.
    - Various other cleanups to build system.

    Implemented bli_getopt().
    
    Details:
    - Added bli_getopt.c and .h files to frame/base. These files implement
      a custom version of getopt(), which may be used to parse command line
      options passed into a program via argc/argv. I am implementing this
      function myself, as opposed to using the version available via unistd.h,
      for portability reasons, as the only requirements are string.h (which
      is available via the standard C library).
    - Modified test suite to allow the user to specify the file name (and/or
      path) to the parameters and operations input files: -g may be used to
      specify the general input file and -o to specify the operations input
      file). If -g or -o or both are not given, default filenames are assumed
      (as well as their existence in the current directory).

    Removed error checks in netlib->BLIS param mapping
    
    Details:
    - Disabled error checking in netlib-to-BLIS parameter mapping functions.
      If the char value input to these functions was not one of the defined
      values, bli_check_error_code() with the appropriate error code value
      would be called, resulting in an abort(). This was unnecessary and
      redundant since these routines are currently only used within the
      BLAS compatibility layer, and they are only called AFTER parameter
      checking has already been performed on the original BLAS char values.
      If the application tried to override xerbla() to prevent an abort()
      from being called, this error checking would still get in the way.
      Thus, instead of reporting the error situation to the framework (ie:
      calling abort()), an arbitrary BLIS parameter value is now chosen and
      the function returns normally. Thanks to Jeff Hammond for finding and
      reporting this issue.

      provided to the macro-kernel implementation via ps_a/ps_b, now we
      store the stride that will advance to the next variable-length
      micro-panel of the triangular matrix A (left) or B (right).
    - Whitespace changes to the files affected above.

      the addresses a2 and b2 (a_next and b_next) with a preprocessor macro
      invocation, bli_is_last_iter(), that tests the same condition.
    - Updated gemm_ukr module to use auxinfo_t argument.
    - Whitespace changes in test suite ukr modules.

    Introduced auxinfo_t argument to micro-kernels.
    
    Details:
    - Removed a_next and b_next arguments to micro-kernels and replaced them
      with a pointer to a new datatype, auxinfo_t, which is simply a struct
      that holds a_next and b_next. The struct may hold other auxiliary
      information that may be useful to a micro-kernel, such as micro-panel
      stride. Micro-kernels may access struct fields via accessor macros
      defined in bli_auxinfo_macro_defs.h.
    - Updated all instances of micro-kernel definitions, micro-kernel calls,
      as well as macro-kernels (for declaring and initializing the structs)
      according to above change.

    Added "ri" scalar macros.
    
    Details:
    - Added set of basic scalar macros that take arguments' real and
      imaginary components separately, named like the previous set except
      with the "ris" (instead of "s") suffix.
    - Redefined the previous set of scalar macros (those that take arguments
      "whole") in terms of the new "ri" set.
    - Renamed setris and getris macros to sets and gets.
    - Renamed setimag0 macros to seti0s.
    - Use bli_?1 macro instead of a local constant in bla_trmv.c, bla_trsv.c.

    Details:
    - Fixed copy-and-paste bug whereby [scz]gemmtrsm_u_opt_d4x4 kernels
      for x86_64/core2 were calling the wrong reference code (l instead
      of u).
    - Fixed some unused variables in x86_64/core2 dotaxpyv and dotxaxpyf

Author: Field G. Van Zee <field@cs.utexas.edu>
Date:   Tue Dec 3 16:08:30 2013 -0600

    Added new "attached" scalar representation.
    
    Details:
    - Added infrastructure to support a new scalar representation, whereby
      every object contains an internal scalar that defaults to 1.0. This
      facilitates passing scalars around without having to house them in
      separate objects. These "attached" scalars are stored in the internal
      atom_t field of the obj_t struct, and are always stored to be the same
      datatype as the object to which they are attached. Level-3 variants no
      longer take scalar arguments, however, level-3 internal back-ends stll
      do; this is so that the calling function can perform subproblems such
      as C := C - alpha * A * B on-the-fly without needing to change either
      of the scalars attached to A or B.
    - Removed scalar argument from packm_int().
    - Observe and apply attached scalars in scalm_int(), and removed scalar
      from interface of scalm_unb_var1().
    - Renamed the following functions (and corresponding invocations):
    
       bli_obj_init_scalar_copy_of()
                               -> bli_obj_scalar_init_detached_copy_of()
       bli_obj_init_scalar()   -> bli_obj_scalar_init_detached()
       bli_obj_create_scalar_with_attached_buffer()
                               -> bli_obj_create_1x1_with_attached_buffer()
       bli_obj_scalar_equals() -> bli_obj_equals()
    
    - Defined new functions:
    
       bli_obj_scalar_detach()
       bli_obj_scalar_attach()
       bli_obj_scalar_apply_scalar()
       bli_obj_scalar_reset()
       bli_obj_scalar_has_nonzero_imag()
       bli_obj_scalar_equals()
    
    - Placed all bli_obj_scalar_* functions in a new file, bli_obj_scalar.c.
    - Renamed the following macros:
    
       bli_obj_scalar_buffer() -> bli_obj_buffer_for_1x1()
       bli_obj_is_scalar()     -> bli_obj_is_1x1()
    
    - Defined new macros to set and copy internal scalars between objects:
    
       bli_obj_set_internal_scalar()
       bli_obj_copy_internal_scalar()
    
    - In level-3 internal back-ends, added conditional blocks where alpha and
      beta are checked for non-unit-ness. Those values for alpha and beta are
      applied to the scalars attached to aliases of A/B/C, as appropriate,
      before being passed into the variant specified by the control tree.
    - In level-3 blocked variants, pass BLIS_ONE into subproblems instead of
      alpha and/or beta.
    - In level-3 macro-kernels, changed how scalars are obtained. Now, scalars
      attached to A and B are multiplied together to obtain alpha, while beta
      is obtained directly from C.
    - In level-3 front-ends, removed old function calls meant to provide
      future support for mixed domain/precision. These can be added back later
      once that functionality is given proper treatment. Also, removed the
      creating of copy-casts of alpha and beta since typecasting of scalars
      is now implicitly handled in the internal back-ends when alpha and
      beta are applied to the attached scalars.

    Details:
    - Updated arm, bgq, loongson3a, and x86_64 kernels so that unimplemented
      datatypes call the corresponding reference kernel. Previously, these
      kernel functions called abort() with a "not yet implemented" error
      message.

    Removed optional scaling from packm control tree.
    
    Details:
    - Removed does_scale field from packm control tree node and
      bli_packm_cntl_obj_create() interface. Adjusted all invocations of
      _cntl_obj_create() accordingly.
    - Redefined/renamted macros that are used in aliasing so that now,
      bli_obj_alias_to() does a full alias (shallow copy) while
      bli_obj_alias_for_packing() does a partial alias that preserves the
      pack_mem-related fields of the aliasing (destination) object.
    - Removed bli_trmm3_cntl.c, .h after realizing that the trmm control tree
      will work just fine for bli_trmm3().
    - Removed some commented vestiges of the typecasting functionality needed
      to support heterogeneous datatypes.

    Outer-to-inner 'restrict' fix in macro-kernels.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed sloppy placement of 'restrict' pointer declarations in level-3
      macro-kernels. Previously, all restricted pointers were being declared
      at the outer-most function scope level. While this violates the C99
      standard, very few of the compilers used with BLIS so far have seemed
      to care. The lone exception has been IBM's xlc. Thanks to Tyler Smith
      for identifying this bug (and suggesting the fix).

    - Commented out object-wrappers in level-1f front-ends. These were not
      working as intended the reference configuration was selected, because
      most kernel sets, such as those in the template set, do not have object
      wrappers.

    Changed dim_t and inc_t to be signed integers.
    
    Details:
    - Redefined dim_t and inc_t in terms of gint_t (instead of guint_t).
      This will facilitate interoperability with Fortran in the future.
      (Fortran does not support unsigned integers.)
    - Redefined many instances of stride-related macros so that they return
      or use the absolute value of the strides, rather than the raw strides
      which may now be signed. Added new macros bli_is_row_stored_f() and
      bli_is_col_stored_f(), which assume positive (forward-oriented) strides,
      and changed the packm_blk_var[23] variants to use these macros instead
      of the existing bli_is_row_stored(), bli_is_col_stored().
    - Added/adjusted typecasting to to various functions/macros, including
      bli_obj_alloc_buffer(), bli_obj_buffer_at_off(), and various pointer-
      related macros in bli_param_macro_defs.h.
    - Redefined bli_convert_blas_incv() macro so that the BLAS compatibility
      layer properly handles situations where vector increments are negative.
      Thanks to Vladimir Sukharev for pointing out this issue.
    - Changed type of increment parameters in bli_adjust_strides() from dim_t
      to inc_t. Likewise in bli_check_matrix_strides().
    - Defined bli_check_matrix_object(), which checks for negative strides.
    - Redefined bli_check_scalar_object() and bli_check_vector_object() so
      that they also check for negative stride.
    - Added instances of bli_check_matrix_object() to various operations'
      _check routines.

      is now enforced when the matrix is packed (bli_packm_blk_var2). Thanks
      to Vladimir Sukharev for reporting this bug.

      d_abs() for completeness. Thanks to Vladimir Sukharev for reporting
      these bugs.

    Fixed bugs in scalm and setm.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed bugs in scalm and setm that resulted in segmentation faults when
      beta is not the same type as the matrix operand. Thanks to Vladimir
      Sukharev for reporting this bug.
    - Changed axpym and scal2m front-ends in fashion similar to that of scalm
      and setm; namely, the alpha scalar is copy-cast the type of the first
      matrix operand.
    - Changed the template and reference configurations' bli_config.h files
      so that the number of memory allocator blocks of A and B are set based
      on BLIS_MAX_NUM_THREADS.
    - Comment updates to bli_obj.c and variable rename in bla_nrm2.c.

    Fixed over/under-flow in complex inversion.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed the complex bli_?inverts() macros, which were inverting elements
      in an "unsafe" manner, such that very large and very small values were
      unnecessarily over/under-flowing. Thanks for Vladimir Sukharev for
      reporting this bug.
    - Comment update to bli_sumsqv_unb_var1.c.
    - Removed redundant bli_min() macro in bli_scalar_macro_defs.h.
    - Changed 1.0F to 1.0 for bli_drands() macro.

    Fixed parameter checking issue in BLAS syr[2]k.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a minor parameter checking bug in the BLAS compatibility layer
      for [sd]syrk and [sd]syr2k. Specifically, if 'C' is passed in for the
      trans parameter of either operation, it is (a) allowed, and (b) treated
      as 'T' (whereas previously it was disallowed). Thanks for Vladimir
      Sukharev for finding and reporting this bug.

    Details:
    - Added a kernel directory for kernels developed by Francisco Igual for
      the Sandy Bridge architecture, including a dgemm ukernel coded with
      AVX intrinsics.
    - Added a configuration for Sandy Bridge using values supplied by Fran.

    Details:
    - Fixed a minor performance bug in bli_gemm_ker_var2.c (and the experimental
      bli_gemm_ker_var5.c) whereby the addresses for a_next and b_next are not
      computed correctly (ie: do not wraparound) at the edge cases. Thanks to

    Added fusing factors, MR/NR to test suite output.
    
    Details:
    - Updated the test suite driver (and modules where appropriate) so that
      the level-1f fusing factors are output along with the variable dimension.
      While this is not strictly necessary, since the fusing factors are output
      in the initial parameter summary, it allows extra reassurance to the user
      since the fusing factors appear alongside the variable dimension, which
      together give a complete picture of the problem size. Similar changes were
      made for outputting the register blocksizes when reporting results for the
      micro-kernel test modules.

    Added test suite modules for level-1f, 3 kernels.
    
    Details:
    - Added test modules in test suite for level-1f kernels and level-3
      micro-kernels. (Duplication in the micro-kernels, for now, is NOT
      supported by these test modules.)
    - Added section override switches to test suite's input.operations file.
    - Added obj_t APIs for level-1f front-ends and their unblocked variants to
      facilitate the level-1f test modules. Also added front-end for dupl
      operation.
    - Added obj_t-based check routines for level-1f operations, which are
      called from the new front-ends mentioned above.
    - Added query routines for axpyf, dotxf, and dotxaxpyf that return fusing
      factors as a function of datatype, which is needed by their respective
      test modules.
    - Whitespace changes to bli_kernel.h of all existing configurations.

    Added section overrides to test suite.
    
    Details:
    - Added new lines of input to the test suite's input.operations file, which
      allows the user to disable entire sections (levels) of tests. Before this
      change, the user had to manually disable each operation tests's "master
      switch". (This is why input.operations.0 existed: to allow a more
      convenient starting point for someone who only wanted to test one or a
      few operations.)

    Added template implementations and other tweaks.
    
    Details:
    - Added a 'template' configuration, which contains stub implementations of the
      level 1, 1f, and 3 kernels with one datatype implemented in C for each, with
      lots of in-file comments and documentation.
    - Modified some variable/parameter names for some 1/1f operations. (e.g.
      renaming vector length parameter from m to n.)
    - Moved level-1f fusing factors from axpyf, dotxf, and dotxaxpyf header files
      to bli_kernel.h.
    - Modifed test suite to print out fusing factors for axpyf, dotxf, and
      dotxaxpyf, as well as the default fusing factor (which are all equal
      in the reference and template implementations).
    - Cleaned up some sloppiness in the level-1f unb_var1.c files whereby these
      reference variants were implemented in terms of front-end routines rather
      that directly in terms of the kernels. (For example, axpy2v was implemented
      as two calls to axpyv rather than two calls to AXPYV_KERNEL.)
    - Changed the interface to dotxf so that it matches that of axpyf, in that
      A is assumed to be m x b_n in both cases, and for dotxf A is actually used
      as A^T.
    - Minor variable naming and comment changes to reference micro-kernels in
      frame/3/gemm/ukernels and frame/3/trsm/ukernels.

        Intel MIC
        IBM BG/Q
        IBM Power7
        AMD Piledriver
        Loogson 3A
      and reorganized kernels directory. Thanks to Tyler Smith, Mike Kistler,
      and Xianyi Zhang for contributing these kernels.
    - Added configurations corresponding to above architectures, and renamed
      "clarksville" configuration to "dunnington".

    Removed default configuration behavior.
    
    Details:
    - Changed the configure script so that it no longer defaults to the
      reference configuration. This change is being made so that the
      developer has a firm awareness of which configuration is being used
      to configure BLIS. Thanks to Mike Kistler and Bryan Marker for this
      suggested change.

    Minor improvements to static memory allocator.
    
    Details:
    - Expanded on cpp macro definitions from bli_mem.c and relocated them to
      a new header file, frame/include/bli_mem_pool_macro_defs.h. The expanded
      functionality includes computing the pool size for each datatype (using
      that datatype's cache blocksizes) and using the maximum to size the
      actual pool array. This addresses the somewhat common pitfall whereby a
      developer updates cache blocksizes in bli_kernel.h for only one datatype
      (say, single-precision real), while the memory pools are sized using the
      double-precision real values. Then, when the developer attempts to link
      to and run a level-3 BLIS routine (e.g. dgemm), the library aborts with
      a message saying the static memory pool was exhausted. Clearly, this
      message is misleading when the pool was not sized properly to begin with.
    - Removed previously disabled code in bli_kernel_macro_defs.h that was
      meant to check for size consistency among the various cache blocksizes.
      (Obviously the memory pool size-based solution mentioned above is better.)
    - Added BLIS_SIZEOF_? cpp macros to bli_type_defs.h. This seemed like a
      reasonable place to put these constants, rather than further crowd up
      bli_config.h.
    - Updated testsuite driver to output memory pool sizes for A, B, and C.
    - Minor comment updates to bli_config.h.
    - Removed 'flame' configuration. It was beginning to get out-of-date, and
      I hadn't used it in months. We can always re-create it later.

Date:   Tue Sep 10 16:35:12 2013 -0500

    Various changes to treatment of integers.
    
    Details:
    - Added a new cpp macro in bli_config.h, BLIS_INT_TYPE_SIZE, which can be
      assigned values of 32, 64, or some other value. The former two result in
      defining gint_t/guint_t in terms of 32- or 64-bit integers, while the latter
      causes integers to be defined in terms of a default type (e.g. long int).
    - Updated bli_config.h in reference and clarksville configurations according
      to above changes.
    - Updated test drivers in test and testsuite to avoid type warnings associated
      with format specifiers not matching the types of their arguments to printf()
      and scanf().
    - Inserted missing #include "bli_system.h" into blis.h (which was slated for
      inclusion in d141f9eeb6d1).
    - Added explicit typecasting of dim_t and inc_t to macros in
      bli_blas_macro_defs.h (which are used in BLAS compatibility layer).
    - Slight changes to CREDITS and INSTALL files.
    - Slight tweaks to Windows build system, mostly in the form of switching to
      Windows-style CRLF newlines for certain files.

    Details:
    - Used void-casts of certain variables to appease gcc (and perhaps other
      compilers) when such variables are only used in the complex instances of
      the functions. Special thanks to Karl Rupp for suggesting a portable fix
      for these warnings.

    Details:
    - Added a 'windows' directory, which contains a Windows build system
      similar to that of libflame's. Thanks to Martin for getting this up
      and running.
    - Spun off system header #includes into bli_system.h, which is included
      in blis.h
    - Added a Windows section to bli_clock.c (similar to libflame's).

    Details:
    - Redefined gint_t and guint_t in terms of the standard C types long int
      and unsigned long int, respectively.
    - Changed testsuite default max problem size to 500.
    - Changed testsuite input.operations to use square problems for level-3
      operation tests.

    Falling back to 32-bit integers for dim_t, etc.
    
    Details:
    - In light of recent segfaulting issues when compiling on 32-bit systems,
      I've changed the default typedef for gint_t and guint_t from int64_t and
      uint64_t to int32_t and uint32_t, respectively.
    - Disabled 64-bit integers in the blas2blis layer for the reference
      configuration.
    - Added type sizes of gint_t, guint_t, and the four floating-point datatypes
      to introductory output of the testsuite.

      matlab/octave format so that one can output in matlab format
      independently from outputting to files.
    - Adjusted input.operations according to above.
    - Added input.operations.0 and input.operations.1 with all options
      disabled and enabled, respectively.

    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in bli_acquire_mpart_t2b() and bli_acquire_mpart_l2r()
      that cause incorrect partitioning when SUBPART0 was requested. This
      bug was introduced in 46d3d09d49ad. Thanks to Bryan for isolating
      this bug.
    - Removed dupl kernels from kernels/x86_64/3 directory.
    - Uncommented beta == 0 optimizaition code in
      kernels/x86_64/3/bli_gemm_opt_d4x4.c.

    Moved init_safe(), finalize_safe() to BLAS compat.
    
    Details:
    - Moved the bli_init_safe() and bli_finalize_safe() function calls from the
      BLAS-like BLIS layer to the BLAS compatibility layer. Having these auto-
      initializers in the BLIS layer wasn't buying us anything because the user
      could still call the library with uninitialized global scalar constants,
      for example. Thus, we will just have to live with the constraint that
      bli_init() MUST be called before calling ANY routine with a bli_ prefix.
    - Added the missing _init_safe() and finalize_safe() calls to the level-1
      BLAS compatibility wrappers.

    Miscellaneous updates.
    
    Details:
    - Changed the BLIS_HEAP_STRIDE_ALIGN_SIZE in the configurations from 16 to
      BLIS_CACHE_LINE_SIZE (typically 64).
    - Changed the use of nr in sizing of bd buffer to packnr in level-3 macro-
      kernels.
    - Reformulated gemm_ker_var2 to look more like the other level-3 macro-
      kernels, in that the interior and edge-case handling is expressed once
      inside the loops in the n and m dimensions, rather than the edge-case
      handling being "unrolled" and expressed as distinct code regions. The
      previous macro-kernel now lives in retired form in the subdirectory
      other/bli_gemm_ker_var2.c.old.
    - Updated experimental gemm_ker_var5 according to above change.
    - Fixed bug in bli_her2k.c whereby incorrect transformations were being
      applied to optimize the macro-kernel accesses pattern on C when C is
      row-stored.
    - Various updates inside of test/exec_sizes.

    - Fixed the misplaced lda parameter in the function signature of
      bla_ger_check(). Thanks to Tyler for finding this bug.

    Fixed cpp guard typos in frame/compat/check files.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed instances of BLIS_ENABLE_BLIS2BLAS that should have been
      BLIS_ENABLE_BLAS2BLIS. Thanks to Tyler for catching this.
    - Fixed various syntax errors in the code that had yet to be compiled
      due to the aforementioned bug.

    Added basic OpenMP-based gemm and packm files.
    
    Details:
    - Integrated Tyler's parallelized packm_blk_var2 and gemm_ker_var2
      into the following auxiliary files
    
        frame/1m/packm/other/bli_packm_blk_var2.c
        frame/3/gemm/other/bli_gemm_ker_var2.c
    
      The routine in the first file uses a basic OpenMP parallel region to
      parallelize the packing of blocks of A and panels of B, while the
      second uses a similar parallel region to parallelize along the n
      dimension of the gemm macro-kernel.

    Added missing cpp kernel blocksize constraints.
    
    Details:
    - Added missing C preprocessor guards in bli_kernel_macro_defs.h that enforce
      constraints on the register blocksizes relative to the cache blocksizes.
      Thanks to Tyler for helping me stumble across this issue.

    Fixed minor warnings and misc issues.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed various warnings output by gcc 4.6.3-1, including removing some
      set-but-not-used variables and addressing some instances of typecasting
      of pointer types to integer types of different sizes.

    Tightened some macros that detect datatypes.
    
    Details:
    - Modified the definitions of some macros, such as bli_is_real(), so that
      the "special" bit is taken into account so that BLIS_INT is differentiated
      from BLIS_FLOAT.
    - Whitespace changes to bli_obj_macro_defs.h.
    - Removed BLIS_SPECIAL_BIT definition from bli_type_defs.h, since it wasn't
      being used.

    Added BLAS error checking to compatibility layer.
    
    Details:
    - Added frame/compat/check directory, which now houses companion _check()
      routines for each of the BLAS wrappers in frame/compat. These _check()
      routines are called from the compatibility wrappers and mimic the
      error-checking present in the netlib BLAS.
    - Edited bla_xerbla.c so that xerbla() translates the operation string to
      uppercase before printing.
    - Redefined util routines in frame/compat/f2c/util in terms of level0
      macros.
    - Added prototypes for util routines, f2c routines, lsame(), and xerbla().
    - Commented out prototypes in test/test_*.c since Fortran integers are now
      int64_t by default (and the prototypes that were present in the files
      used int).
    - Removed redundant #include "bli_f2c.h" in bli_?lamch.c and bli_lsame.c,
      since blis.h was already being included.
    - Other minor changes to code in frame/compat/f2c.

    Added support for C99 complex types/arithmetic.
    
    Details:
    - Added support for C99 complex types to bli_type_defs.h and overloaded
      complex arithmetic to the scalar-level macros in include/level0. This
      includes a somewhat substantial reorganization and re-layering of much
      of the existing machinery present in the level0 macros.
    - Added new #define for BLIS_ENABLE_C99_COMPLEX to bli_config.h files,
      commented-out by default, which optionally enables the use of built-in
      C99 complex types and arithmetic.
    - Minor changes to clarksville and reference configs' make_defs.mk files.
    - Removed macro definitions from bli_param_macro_defs.h which was not being
      used (bli_proj_dt_to_real_if_imag_eq0).

    Fixed bugs in trsm, trmm macro-kernels.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in trsm_rl_ker_var2() caused by incorrect edge case handling.
    - Fixed a bug in trsm_rl_ker_var2() and trsm_ru_ker_var2() whereby k was
      incorrectly being adjusted upward by MR, instead of NR. The rl and ru
      trmm macro-kernels were updated in a similar fashion.
    - Fixed a bug in trsm_ru_ker_var2() that was due to a missing negation on
      diagoffb when recomputing k to skip a zero region below where the
      diagonal intersects the right side of the block. The corresponding
      trmm macro-kernel was also updated.
    - Fixed a bug in trsm_ru_ker_var2() where the the adjustment of k (by NR)
      needed to be placed AFTER the block that recomputes k to skip the zero
      region (if present). The other three trsm macro-kernels, as well as the
      trmm macro-kernels, were updated in the same manner, for consistency.
    - Fixed a bug in trmm_lu_ker_var2() in which the wrong dimension (n) was
      being updated to skip a zero region to the left of where the diagonal
      of A intersects the top edge of the block.
    - Comment updates to all trsm and trmm macro-kernels.
    - Comment updates to bli_packm_init.c.

    Details:
    - Retired (for now) existing ?rot*() BLAS compatibility wrappers to 'attic'
      along with other wrappers for which no BLIS implementation exists.
    - Added f2c-generated codes for applicable datatype flavors of rot, rotg,
      rotm, and rotmg operations.

    Removed copynzv, copynzm and related codes.
    
    Details:
    - Removed copynzv and copynzm operation directories. These operations
      implemented a variation of copyv/m that, in the case of real source
      and complex destination operands, leaves the imaginary component
      untouched (rather than setting it to zero). I realize now that the
      special case(s) (e.g. gemm with real A and B but complex C) that I
      thought required this operation actually can be handled more simply.
    - Removed level0 scalar macros implementing copynzs, copynzjs.

    Added handling of restrict, stdint.h for non-C99.
    
    Details:
    - Removed the #include <stdint.h> from blis.h and inserted a cpp macro block
      in bli_type_defs.h that #includes <stdint.h> for C++ and C99, and otherwise
      manually typedefs the types we need (which, for now, are unconditionally
      int64_t and uint64_t).
    - Moved basic typedefs to top of bli_type_defs.h, and comment changes.
    - Added cpp macro block to bli_macro_defs.h that #defines restrict as
      nothing for C++ and non-C99.

Author: Field G. Van Zee <field@cs.utexas.edu>
Date:   Mon Jul 8 15:20:34 2013 -0500

    Migrated integer usage to stdint.h types.
    
    Details:
    - Changed the way bli_type_defs.h defines integer types so that dim_t,
      inc_t, doff_t, etc. are all defined in terms of gint_t (general signed
      integer) or guint_t (general unsigned integer).
    - Renamed Fortran types fchar and fint to f77_char and f77_int.
    - Define f77_int as int64_t if a new configuration variable,
      BLIS_ENABLE_BLIS2BLAS_INT64, is defined, and int32_t otherwise.
      These types are defined in stdint.h, which is now included in blis.h.
    - Renamed "complex" type in f2c files to "singlecomplex" and typedef'ed
      in terms of scomplex.
    - Renamed "char" type in f2c files to "character" and typedef'ed in terms
      of char.
    - Updated bla_amax() wrappers so that the return type is defined directly
      as f77_int, rather than letting the prototype-generating macro decide
      the type. This was the only use of GENTFUNC2I/GENTPROT2I-related macros,
      so I removed them. Also, changed the body of the wrapper so that a
      gint_t is passed into abmaxv, which is THEN typecast to an f77_int
      before returning the value.
    - Updated f2c code that accessed .r and .i fields of complex and
      doublecomplex types so that they use .real and .imag instead (now that
      we are using scomplex and dcomplex).

    Added experimental bli_gemm_ker_var5().
    
    Details:
    - Added support for an experimental gemm macro-kernel incrementally
      packs one micro-panel of B at a time. This is useful for certain
      special cases of gemm where m is small.
    - Minor changes to default values of clarksville configuration.
    - Defined BLIS_PACKED_BLOCKS as part of pack_t type, even though we
      do not yet have any use (or implementation support) for block storage.
    - Comment update to bli_packm_init.c.

    Defined "total" blocksize query functions.
    
    Details:
    - Defined bli_blksz_total_for_type() and bli_blksz_total_for_obj() to query
      the default blocksize plus blocksize extension (using the type or the type
      of an object).
    - Comment update in bli_packm_cxk.c.

    Consolidated lower/upper her[2]k blocked variants.
    
    Details:
    - Consolidated lower and upper blocked variants for herk and her2k, and
      renamed the resulting variants, according to the same changes recently
      made to trmm and trsm.
    - Implemented support for four new subpartitions types:
        BLIS_SUBPART1T
        BLIS_SUBPART1B
        BLIS_SUBPART1L
        BLIS_SUBPART1R
      which correspond to "merged" partitions that include the middle "1"
      partition as well as either the neighboring "0" or "2" partition. This is
      used to clean up code in herk/her2k var2 that attempts to partition away
      the strictly zero region above or below the diagonal of a matrix operand
      that is being marched through diagonally.
    - Added safeguards to herk macro-kernels that skip any leading or trailing
      zero region in the panel of C that is passed in. This is now needed given
      that herk/her2k var1 no longer partitions off this zero region before
      calling the macro-kernel (via bli_her[2]k_int()).
    - Updated comments and other whitespace changes to trmm/trsm macro-kernels.

    Added row-storage optimizations for trmm, trsm.
    
    Details:
    - Implemented algorithmic optimizations for trmm and trsm whereby the right
      side case is now handled explicitly, rather than induced indirectly by
      transposing and swapping strides on operands. This allows us to walk through
      the output matrix with favorable access patterns no matter how it is stored,
      for all parameter combinations.
    - Renamed trmm and trsm blocked variants so that there is no longer a
      lower/upper distinction. Instead, we simply label the variants by which
      dimension is partitioned and whether the variant marches forwards or
      backwards through the corresponding partitioned operands.
    - Added support for row-stored packing of lower and upper triangular matrices
      (as provided by bli_packm_blk_var3.c).
    - Fixed a performance bug in bli_determine_blocksize_b() whereby the cache
      blocksize  extensions (if non-zero) were not being used to appropriately size
      the first iteration (ie: the bottom/right edge case).
    - Updated comments in bli_kernel.h to indicate that both MC and NC must be
      whole multiples of MR AND NR. This is needed for the case of trsm_r where,
      in order to reuse existing left-side gemmtrsm fused micro-kernels, the
      packing of A (left-hand operand) and B (right-hand operand) is done with
      NR and MR, respectively (instead of MR and NR).

    Use separate CFLAGS for "kernels" directories.
    
    Details:
    - Added a new "special" directory type: any source code within directories
      named "kernels" will be compiled with a separate CFLAGS_KERNELS set of
      compiler flags. This allows the developer to specify a separate set of
      flags (e.g. optimization flags) for compiling kernels while maintaining a
      standard set for regular framework code.
    - Fixed a bug in the top-level Makefile that was causing "noopt" code
      to be compiled with the standard set of compilation flags.
    - Updated make_defs.mk in reference, flame, and clarksville configurations
      according to above changes.

    Various level-3 optimizations for row storage.
    
    Details:
    - Implemented remaining two cases within bli_packm_blk_var2(), which allow
      packing from a lower or upper-stored symmetric/Hermitian matrix to column
      panels (which are row-stored). Previously one could only pack to row panels
      (which are column-stored).
    - Implemented various optimizations in the level-3 front-ends that allow more
      favorable access through row-stored matrices for gemm, hemm, herk, her2k,
      symm, syrk, and syr2k.
    - Cleaned up code in level-3 front-ends that has to do with setting target and
      execution datatypes.

    Added beta == 0 optimization to x86_64 ukernel.
    
    Details:
    - Modified x86_64 gemm microkernel so that when beta is zero, C is not read
      from memory (nor scaled by beta).
    - Fixed minor bug in test suite driver when "Test all combinations of storage
      schemes?" switch is disabled, which would result in redundant tests being
      executed for matrix-only (e.g. level-1m, level-3) operations if multiple
      vector storage schemes were specified.
    - Restored debug flags as default in clarksville configuration.

    - Updated level-1/-1f kernels so that non-unit and un-aligned cases are
      handled by reference implementation (rather than aborted).
    - Added -fomit-frame-pointer to default make_defs.mk for clarksville
      configuration.
    - Defined bli_offset_from_alignment() macro.

    - Use BLIS_MAX_TYPE_SIZE to define BLIS_CONSTANT_SLOT_SIZE instead of
      sizeof(dcomplex).

Author: Field G. Van Zee <field@cs.utexas.edu>
Date:   Fri May 24 16:28:10 2013 -0500

    Fixed x86_64 kernel bugs and other minor issues.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed bugs in trmv_l and trsv_u due to backwards iteration resulting in
      unaligned subpartitions. We were already going out of our way a bit to
      handle edge cases in the first iteration for blocked variants, and this
      was simply the unblocked-fused extension of that idea.
    - Fixed control tree handling in her/her2/syr/syr2 that was not taking
      into account how the choice of variant needed to be altered for
      upper-stored matrices (given that only lower-stored algorithms are
      explicitly implemented).
    - Added bli_determine_blocksize_dim_f(), bli_determine_blocksize_dim_b()
      macros to provide inlined versions of bli_determine_blocksize_[fb]() for
      use by unblocked-fused variants.
    - Integrated new blocksize_dim macros into gemv/hemv unf variants for
      consistency with that of the bugfix for trmv/trsv (both of which now
      use the same macros).
    - Modified bli_obj_vector_inc() so that 1 is returned if the object is a
      vector of length 1 (ie: 1 x 1). This fixes a bug whereby under certain
      conditions (e.g. dotv_opt_var1), an invalid increment was returned, which
      was invalid only because the code was expecting 1 (for purposes of
      performing contiguous vector loads) but got a value greater than 1 because
      the column stride of the object (e.g. rho) was inflated for alignment
      purposes (albeit unnecessarily since there is only one element in the
      object).
    - Replaced some old invocations of set0 with set0s.
    - Added alpha parameter to gemmtrsm ukernels for x86_64 and use accordingly.
    - Fixed increment bug in cleanup loop of gemm ukernel for x86_64.
    - Added safeguard to test modules so that testing a problem with a zero
      dimension does not result in a failure.
    - Tweaked handling of zero dimensions in level-2 and level-3 operations'
      internal back-ends to correctly handle cases where output operand still
      needs to be scaled (e.g. by beta, in the case of gemm with k = 0).

    Renamed _trans_status() macro.
    
    Details:
    - Mistakenly forgot to rename the _trans_status() macro and instances in
      previous commit.

    Renamed _set_trans(), _trans_status() macros.
    
    Details:
    - Renamed the following macros:
        bli_obj_set_trans()    -> bli_obj_set_onlytrans()
        bli_obj_trans_status() -> bli_obj_onlytrans_status()
      to remove ambiguity as to which bits are read/updated.

    Unconditionally check memory pool(s) for errors.
    
    Details:
    - Changed bli_mem_acquire_m() in bli_mem.c so that we still check if the
      memory pool is exhausted before checking out and returning a block, even
      if BLIS error checking has been disabled. These errors are useful because
      they likely indicate that BLIS was improperly configured for the code
      being run.

Date:   Tue Apr 30 19:35:54 2013 -0500

    Absorbed blocksize extensions into main objects.
    
    Details:
    - Revamped some parts of commit b6ef84fad1c9 by adding blocksize extension
      fields to the blksz_t object rather than have them as separate structs.
    - Updated all packm interfaces/invocations according to above change.
    - Generalized bli_determine_blocksize_?() so that edge case optimization
      happens if and only if cache blocksizes are created with non-zero
      extensions.
    - Updated comments in bli_kernel.h files to indicate that the edge case
      blocksize extension mechanism is now available for use.

    Added option to disable err checking in testsuite.
    
    Details:
    - Added a new line to input.general that allows one to specify the error-
      checking level to use for each BLIS experiment. The only two levels
      supported for now are "no error checking" and "full error checking".

    Use cntl trees that block in n dimension.
    
    Details:
    - Updated _cntl.c files for each level-3 operation to induce blocked
      algorithms that first paritition in the n dimension with a blocksize
      of NC. Typically this is not an issue since only very large problems
      exceed that of NC. But developers often run very large problems, and
      so this extra blocking should be the default.
    - Removed some recently introduced but now unused macros from
      bli_param_macro_defs.h.

    Use PASTEMAC in macro-kernels (over MAC2 or MAC3).
    
    Details:
    - Replaced multi-type invocations of copys_mxn, xpbys_mxn, etc. (PASTEMAC2
      and PASTEMAC3) with those that only use a single type (PASTEMAC).
    - Added extra macros to bli_adds_mxn_uplo.h and bli_xpbys_mxn_uplo.h to
      accommodate above change.
    - Fixed comment typo in bli_config.h files.
    - Added .nfs* pattern to .gitignore.

    Fixed computation of b_next in L3 macro-kernels.
    
    Details:
    - Restructured herk_l and herk_u macro-kernels in the imagine of trmm
      and trsm, in that the edge cases are captured by the main loop, rather
      than trying to have "cleanup" sections that result in four distinct
      parts (interior, bottom edge, right edge, bottom-right edge) of the
      code.
    - Fixed the way b_next was being computed in the non-gemm level-3
      macro-kernels (herk, trmm, trsm). The way they are computed now matches
      that of gemm.

    Fixed rare edge case bug in herk_l macro-kernel.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a potential bug in herk_l at the m_left edge case. If MR was
      chosen to be much larger than NR, then one could encounter edge cases
      in the the MC dimension that fall entirely below the diagonal, which
      the previous implementation of the herk_l macro-kernel was not allowing
      for.

Author: Field G. Van Zee <field@cs.utexas.edu>
Date:   Tue Apr 23 16:00:18 2013 -0500

    Added a_next, b_next arguments to micro-kernels.
    
    Details:
    - Added two more arguments to the gemm and gemmtrsm microkernels: the
      addresses of the next micro-panels of A and B. By passing these
      pointers into the micro-kernel, we allow the micro-kernel author to
      prefetch micro-panels of A and B as necessary (though this is
      completely optional; these addresses may also be safely ignored).
    - Updated all seven macro-kernels so that they compute and pass in
      a_next and b_next. Note that ONLY the gemm macro-kernel computes
      a_next and b_next with the precise semantics we want. I will go back
      and fix the other macro-kernels in the near future.
    - Added 'restrict' to various micro-kernels from which it was missing.

    Added code for backward edge-case blocking.
    
    Disabled:
    - Edited bli_determine_blocksize_b() to include experimental (and
      currently disabled) code that computes extended blocks.
    - Updated commnts relate to above changes.
    - Enabled use of x86 gemmtrsm ukernel in config/flame/bli_kernel.h.

    Updated dupl implementation to use PACKNR and NR.
    
    Details:
    - Updated frame/util/dupl/bli_dupl_unb_var1.c to utilize PACKNR and NR
      explicitly so navigate b1 so that situations where PACKNR > NR are
      supported.
    - Moved the 4x2 and 4x4 reference micro-kernels in frame/3/gemm/ukernels and
      frame/3/trsm/ukernels to kernels/c99/.
    - Updated clarksville and flame configurations.

    Disabled blocksize checks for memory pools.
    
    Details:
    - Temporarily disabled checks that ensure that enough memory will be allocated
      by the contiguous memory allocator for all types, given that the values for
      double precision real are the ones used to allocate the space. These checks
      can easily go awry in certain situations, especially if you are developing for
      only one datatype. So for now, they are probably more trouble than they are
      worth.

    Allow ldim of packed micro-panels != MR, NR.
    
    Details:
    - Made substantial changes throughout the framework to decouple the leading
      dimension (row or column stride) used within each packed micro-panel from
      the corresponding register blocksize. It appears advantageous on some
      systems to use, for example, packed micro-panels of A where the column
      stride is greater than MR (whereas previously it was always equal to MR).
    - Changes include:
      - Added BLIS_EXTEND_[MNK]R_? macros, which specify how much extra padding
        to use when packing micro-panels of A and B.
      - Adjusted all packing routines and macro-kernels to use PACKMR and PACKNR
        where appropriate, instead of MR and NR.
      - Added pd field (panel dimension) to obj_t.
      - New interface to bli_packm_cntl_obj_create().
      - Renamed bli_obj_packed_length()/_width() macros to
        bli_obj_padded_length()/_width().
      - Removed local #defines for cache/register blocksizes in level-3 *_cntl.c.
      - Print out new cache and register blocksize extensions in test suite.
    - Also added new BLIS_EXTEND_[MNK]C_? macros for future use in using a larger
      blocksize for edge cases, which can improve performance at the margins.

    Fixed bug in compatibility layer (her2k/syr2k).
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in the BLAS compatibility layer, specifically in bla_her2k.c
      and bla_syr2k.c, that caused incorrect computation to occur when the BLAS
      interface caller requests the [conjugate-]transpose case. Thanks to Bryan
      Marker for reporting the behavior that led to this bug.

    Changed old level3 test drivers to call front-ends.
    
    Details:
    - Changed old level-3 test drivers, in 'test' directory, to always call the
      front-end object API instead of the internal back-end with the locally
      defined control tree.

    Allow packm_init() to reacquire a too-small mem_t.
    
    Details:
    - Changed bli_packm_init() to react differently to a situation where a pack
      obj_t has an already-allocated mem_t entry that has a buffer that is smaller
      than what will be needed to hold the block/panel that now needs to be
      packed. Previously, this situation was treated with an abort() since I
      assumed something was horribly wrong. I have changed the code so that it now
      reacts by releasing the previous mem_t and re-acquires a new mem_t with the
      new information. (This change was done at the request of Bryan Marker to
      facilitate code generation via DxT.)

    Fixed bug in packing block of A for hemm/symm.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in bli_packm_blk_var2() that affected the packing functionality
      of hemm and symm. The bug occurs whenever attempting to pack a Hermitian or
      symmetric matrix where the block of A being packed intersects the diagonal,
      but some of its micro-panels do not intersect the diagonal and lie completely
      in the unstored region. Thanks to Francisco Igual for reporting this bug.
    - Comment updates to both _blk_var2.c and _blk_var3.c.

    Activated bli_packm_acquire_mpart_t2b().
    
    Details:
    - Removed the overly-paranoid bli_abort() from the end of
      bli_packm_acquire_mpart_t2b(), to allow others to experiment with
      partitioning through packed blocks of A. Also, and more importantly,
      changed an earlier check that was causing an erroneous (but
      coincidentally redundant) abort(). Also, updated some of the comments
      in bli_packm_part.c.

    Allow creation of "empty" objects.
    
    Details:
    - Modified bli_obj_alloc_buffer() to allow allocating an empty buffer, and
      modified bli_adjust_strides() to explicitly handle m = n = 0.
    - Updated bli_check_matrix_strides() to allow cases where m = n = 0.

    Fixed "root" object bug in bli_her[2]k/syr[2]k.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed an obscure bug in the front-ends for herk, her2k, syrk, and syr2k,
      that manifested as the incorrect triangle being updated. It occurred when
      the user would pass in a matrix object that was correctly marked as
      symmetric/Hermitian and lower-stored, but whose root object was never marked
      as lower (or upper). We now alias and re-assign root status for matrix C
      within the front-ends. Note that trmm and trsm were already doing this,
      albeit for a slightly different reason (to allow the internal back-end to
      choose which algorithm to run--lower or upper--based on the uplo of the root
      object for both left and right side cases). Thanks to Bryan Marker for
      leading me to this bug.

    Fixed overzealous type-checking in bli_getsc().
    
    Details:
    - Relaxed type checking in getsc so that the input object could be a constant
      and not just a proper floating-point type. (If it is a constant, default to
      extracting the dcomplex values.) Thanks to Bryan Marker for reporting this
      bug.
    - Added definition for bli_is_constant() in bli_param_macro_defs.h
    - Comment updates to various level-0 scalar routines.

    Fixed bug in bli_obj_is_packed() and renamed.
    
    Details:
    - This macro is used to determine whether the partitioning routines should
      call a corresponding packm_part routine instead. However, it was
      unintentionally catching matrices that were marked as "packed" by virtue
      of them simply being marked as BLIS_PACKED_UNSPEC in, say, bli_gemv().
      The macro has now been renamed to bli_obj_is_panel_packed(), and now only
      checks for row or column panel packing. (Note that I first attempted to
      fix this bug in a571af816d72.) Thanks to Bryan Marker for reporting the
      erroneous behavior that led me to this bug.

    Tweak to test suite function string construction.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a minor bug in the way that the test suite would construct function
      name strings when the user anchored all parameters in input.operations.
      In this case, the test driver would mistake this situation for one where
      the operation simply had no parameters to begin with, and thus would not
      include the parameter string in the function string that is output for
      every result.

    Modified bli_kernel.h include order in blis.h.
    
    Details:
    - Delayed #include of bli_kernel.h in blis.h to prevent a situation where
      _kernel.h includes an optimized microkernel header, which uses BLIS types
      such as dim_t and inc_t, which would precede the definition of those types
      in bli_type_defs.h.
    - Moved the #include of bli_kernel_macro_defs.h in bli_macro_defs.h to blis.h
      (immediately after that of bli_kernel.h).

    Added/renamed alignment constants to _config.h.
    
    Details:
    - Added new memory alignment constants:
        BLIS_HEAP_STRIDE_ALIGN_SIZE   (previously assumed to be same as SYSTEM_MEM)
        BLIS_CONTIG_ADDR_ALIGN_SIZE   (previously assumed to be same as PAGE_SIZE)
        BLIS_STACK_BUF_ALIGN_SIZE     (previously not enforced)
      and renamed existing ones
        BLIS_SYSTEM_MEM_ALIGN_SIZE -> BLIS_HEAP_ADDR_ALIGN_SIZE
        BLIS_CONTIG_MEM_ALIGN_SIZE -> BLIS_CONTIG_STRIDE_ALIGN_SIZE
      to better convey what the alignment factor is used for (and what it is
      not used for).
    - Removed BLIS_ENABLE_SYSTEM_MEM_ALIGN. Dynamic memory alignment is now
      disabled by setting BLIS_HEAP_STRIDE_ALIGN_SIZE to 1.
    - Inserted instances of __attribute__((aligned(BLIS_STACK_BUF_ALIGN_SIZE)))
      into macro-kernels to specify stack alignment of temporary buffers.
    - Modified test suite driver to output new constants.
    - Removed bli_align_dim_to_sys() and bli_align_dim_to_cmem(). Instead, we now
      use bli_align_dim_to_size(), which takes a third argument (the desired
      alignment).

    Fixed an bug in axpyv/axpym when alpha is unit.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed bug whereby axpyv and axpym were incorrectly simplifying to a copy,
      rather than an add, when alpha = 1. Thanks to Bryan Marker for identifying
      this bug.

    Moved _POSIX_C_SOURCE def to compiler cmd line.
    
    Details:
    - Removed the #define of _POSIX_C_SOURCE in bli_config.h (for both reference
      and clarksville configurations) and added "-D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200112L" to
      the compiler command line arguments in make_defs.mk (for both configs).
      Thanks to Devin Matthews for suggesting this change.

    Appended 'f2c_' to abs, min, max macros in f2c.h.
    
    Details:
    - Renamed abs, min, max, dmin, and dmax macros in bli_f2c.h so that they
      would not conflict with anything defined by the user (or the language).
      Thanks to Devin Matthews for suggesting this fix.
    - Updated all instances of the above macros accordingly.

    Added new kernel blocksize macro aliases.
    
    Details:
    - Added new macros that alias level-3 cache and register blocksize macros
      to names that can be constructed via the PASTEMAC macro. These aliased
      macro definitions live inside bli_kernel_macro_defs.h, which is now
      #included after bli_kernel.h.
    - Modified macro-kernels to use new aliased blocksize macros instead of
      operation-specific ones.
    - Removed local, operation-specific kernel blocksize macro definitions
      (found in macro-kernel header files).

    Reverted testsuite object files' home to 'obj'.
    
    Details:
    - Removed 'obj' and 'lib' from .gitignore.
    - Added testsuite/obj/.gitkeep (which is an empty file).
    - Updated testsuite/Makefile accordingly.
    - Thanks to Vernon Austel for pointing out the .gitkeep trick to tracking

    - Replaced scalar constant macro definitions in bli_const_defs.h with a single,
      simplier macro in bli_obj_macro_defs.h.
    - Updated invocations of old macros accordingly.

    Fixed a performance bug in trsm.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug in the reference implementations of the gemmtrsm wrappers
      (bli_gemmtrsm_l_ref_mxn.c and bli_gemmtrsm_u_ref_mxn.c) whereby the
      reference gemm microkernel was hard-coded, and thus always called, even
      when GEMM_UKERNEL was defined to point to an optimzied microkernel. This
      manifested as artificially low trsm performance for all problem sizes, but
      especially for small problem sizes as it only affected blocks of A that
      intersected the diagonal. Thanks to Mike Kistler of IBM for helping me
      find this bug.

    Generate testsuite objects 'src'.
    
    Details:
    - Tweaked the testsuite makefile so that object files are stored in 'src'
      rather than 'obj', since (a) the top-level .gitignore dictates that
      obj directories are to be ignored, and (b) since git has problems
      tracking empty directories. Now, users do not need to create their own
      obj directories within their own local clones of BLIS.

    Fixed definition of bli_is_packed_object() macro.
    
    Details:
    - Changed the definition of bli_is_packed_object() so that it keys off of the
      value of the pack schema bits in the info field of obj_t, rather than
      comparing the obj_t buffer with that of the mem_t entry. This was the cause
      of a very low probability bug whereby uninitialized memory caused the macro
      to evaluate to TRUE even though the object in question was not packed.
      Thanks to Vernon Austel of IBM for helping discover this bug.
    - Changed an abort() in bli_packm_part() to a not-yet-implemented.

    Fixed edge case handling bug in herk macrokernels.
    
    Details:
    - Fixed a bug present in bli_herk_l_ker_var2() and bli_herk_u_ker_var2() that
      only manifests when BLIS is configured such that MR != NR. The bug involves
      incorrectly detecting edge cases, which resulted in some parts of matrix C
      potentially being skipped and not updated, depending on the problem size.
    - Updated the default values of MR and NR in config/reference/bli_kernel.h to
      8 and 4, respectively, so that I can better stress the framework on a
      day-to-day basis. (The fact that they were both equal to 4 for so long is
      why I did not stumble upon this bug much sooner.)

Author: Field G. Van Zee <field@cs.utexas.edu>
Date:   Thu Apr 4 15:25:43 2013 -0500

    Added reference microkernels for arbitrary MR, NR.
    
    Details:
    - Added a new set of reference gemm, gemmtrsm, and trsm micro-kernels that
      contain explicit loops over MR and NR, thus allowing them to be used
      unmodified by developers who want to build a reference library with
      custom register blocksizes.
    - Changed config/reference/bli_kernel.h to use above ukernels by default.
    - Changed interfaces of new and existing gemm, gemmtrsm, and trsm micro-kernels
      to use 'restrict' keyword.
    - Added -funroll-loops option to config/reference/make_defs.mk.
    - Updated comments in bli_kernel.h describing constraints on register and
      cache blocksizes.
    - Updated _adds_mxn.h, _copys_mxn.h, and _xpbys_mxn.h macros files so that
      single-char macros are also defined.

    - Added integer support to [f]printv, [f]printm.
    - Added integer support to level-0 copys macros.
    - Updated printing of configuration information in test suite driver.
    - Comment changes to _config.h files.

    More memory alignment-related tweaks.
    
    Details:
    - Renamed BLIS_MEMORY_ALIGNMENT_SIZE to BLIS_CONTIG_MEM_ALIGN_SIZE.
    - Renamed BLIS_ENABLE_MEMORY_ALIGNMENT to BLIS_ENABLE_SYSTEM_MEM_ALIGN.
    - Added BLIS_SYSTEM_MEM_ALIGN_SIZE, which controls only the alignment
      passed into posix_memalign() or equivalent.
    - Defined new function, bli_align_dim_to_cmem(), which applies the
      contiguous memory alignment (rather than the system/malloc alignment).

    Always define memory alignment size cpp constant.

      Memory alignment should always be enabled, and so this value should
      always be defined.

    Align packed panel strides with system alignment.
    
    Details:
    - Pass panel strides through bli_align_dim_to_sys() to ensure that each
      subsequent packed panel of A and B begins at an aligned address. (The
      first panel is presumably aligned to system alignment because it is
      aligned to a page boundary, which is typically much larger.)
    - Rearranged code in packm_init_pack() to prevent additional conditional
      blocks as a result of the aforementioned change.
    - Adjusted contiguous memory allocator so that the system memory alignment
      is used to allocate enough space for each block no matter what kind of
      register blocking is used (even if register blocksize is unit and every
      row/column needs maximal padding).
    - Adjusted default blocksizes in reference configuration so that MC*KC
      and KC*NC result in identical footprints for all datatypes.

    Removed #include "blis2.h" from low-level headers.
    
    Details:
    - Removed #include of "blis2.h" from various lower-level, operation-specific
      header files throughout the framework. Given that these low-level headers
      are included within #blis2.h in a very specific order, #include'ing blis2.h
      within them directly is unnecessary.

    Added cpp guards to conflicting libflame typedefs.
    
    Details:
    - Added cpp guards around the definitions of dim_t, scomplex, and dcomplex.
      This is a temporary hack to allow interoperability with libflame. (Similarly
      temporary changes are being made to libflame's type definitions file.)

    Renamed MAX_PREFETCH_BYTE_OFFSET to MAX_PRELOAD_.
    
    Details:
    - Renamed BLIS_MAX_PREFETCH_BYTE_OFFSET to
      BLIS_MAX_PRELOAD_BYTE_OFFSET since "prefetch" is kind of a loaded word
      (e.g. "prefetch" instructions, which are different than the particular

    Relocated packed mem_t dimension fields to obj_t.
    
    Details:
    - Removed the m and n (and elem_size) fields from the mem_t object, and added
      m_packed and n_packed fields to obj_t. These new fields track the same as
      the old ones. From an abstraction standpoint, it seemed awkward to store
      those dimensions inside the mem_t.
    - Updated interfaces to bl2_mem_acquire_*() so that only a byte size argument
      is passed in, instead of m, n, and elem_size.
    - Updated bl2_packm_init_pack() and bl2_packv_init_pack() to inline the
      functionality of bl2_mem_alloc_update_m() and bl2_mem_alloc_update_v(),
      respectively.
    - Updated packm variants to access the packed length and width fields from
      their new locations.

    Re-implemented contiguous memory allocator.
    
    Details:
    - Completely re-wrote the contiguous memory allocator (bl2_mem.c). The new
      allocator instantiates and initializes three separate memory pool objects,
      each one associated with a separate array of contiguous memory blocks, each
      block of fixed and uniform size. (The three pools are for allocating mc-by-kc
      blocks of A, kc-by-nc panels of B, and mc-by-nc panels of C.) The pool
      objects use a stack structure internally to track which blocks in the region
      have been "checked out" to a thread and which are still available. Critical
      regions are now clearly marked and adaptable to parallel environments (e.g.
      OpenMP). Memory pools are set up when bl2_init() is called.
    - Added a new field to the packm control tree node, which indicates what kind
      of packed buffer is being allocated. The enumerated type for this argument
      is defined as packbuf_t in bl2_type_defs.h.
    - Updated level-3 _cntl.c files to pass in the appropriate value for a new
      packbuf_t argument to bl2_packm_cntl_obj_create().
    - Moved some macros called by packm_init_pack() from bl2_obj_macro_defs.h to
      bl2_mem_macro_defs.h.
    - Added BLIS_MAX_NUM_THREADS to bl2_config.h, which we use as the default
      number of blocks of A reserved for the memory allocator.
    - Deprecated bl2_align_dim(). Replaced usage with that of
      bl2_align_dim_to_mult(). Turns out that typically we don't need to align
      a dimension to the system alignment, since that value has to do with
      starting addresses, whereas the values we are dealing with are unitless
      dimensions.

    Perform her2k var1 loops in sequence.
    
    Details:
    - Changed variant 1 of her2k so that the two rank-k products are computed
      and accumulated in sequence rather than fused into one loop. This is
      necessary if BLIS is to be configured to provide only enough contiguous
      memory for one panel of B.

    Enhanced tracking of dimensions for mem_t objects.
    
    Details:
    - Added new fields to mem_t struct definition to track the allocated (as
      opposed to the currently used) dimensions of the memory region. This
      allows packm_init() to be more robust in situations where memory is
      already allocated but is more than needed for the current packing job.
    - Updated logic in bl2_obj_set_buffer_with_cached_packm_mem() macro, used
      in packm_init(), to update the "currently used" dimensions of the mem_t
      object if the requested dimensions are smaller than the allocated
      dimensions.

    Details:
    - Changed bl2_obj_induce_trans() so that the transposition bit is no longer
      updated as part of the macro. All current uses of the macro have been
      coupled with instances of bl2_obj_set_trans() to clear the bit.
    - Added Jed to CREDITS file.

    Replaced banded/packed BLAS2 stubs with f2c code.
    
    Details:
    - Retired the blas2blis wrappers that simply called abort with a "not yet
      implemented" message. This includes all of the level-2 banded and packed
      routines.
    - Replaced the aforementioned with the corresponding netlib implementations
      having been run through f2c (with some customization).
    - Added directories named 'attic' to build/gen-make-frags/ignore_list.

    Moved Fortran name-mangling macro to bl2_config.h.
    
    Details:
    - Moved the Fortran-77 name-mangling macros from bl2_blas_macro_defs.h to the
      configuration directory (bl2_config.h, specifically) given that it can be
      expected to be tweaked by some developers.

    Implemented blas2blis compatibility layer.
    
    Details:
    - Added the blas2blis compatibility layer, located in frame/compat. This
      includes virtually all of the BLAS, including banded and packed level-2
      operations.
    
    - Defined bl2_init_safe(), bl2_finalize_safe(). The former allows a conditional
      initialization, which stores the "exit status" in an err_t, which is then
      read by the latter function to determine whether finalization should actually
      take place.
    - Added calls to bl2_init_safe(), bl2_finalize_safe() to all level-2 and
      level-3 BLAS-like wrappers.
    - Added configuration option to instruct BLIS to remain initialized whenever
      it automatically initializes itself (via bl2_init_safe()), until/unless the
      application code explicitly calls bl2_finalize().
    
    - Added INSERT_GENTFUNC* and INSERT_GENTPROT* macros to facilitate type
      templatization of blas2blis wrappers.
    - Defined level-0 scalar macro bl2_??swaps().
    - Defined level-1v operation bl2_swapv().
    - Defined some "Fortran" types to bl2_type_defs.h for use with BLAS
      wrappers.

    Fixed some scalar types in BLAS-like Herm APIs.
    
    Details:
    - Some of the scalars of Hermitian operations, such as alpha in her,
      alpha and beta in herk, and beta in her2k, need to be real. These
      arguments were typed incorrectly as the complex types. This has been
      fixed. Note the issue was only present in the BLAS-like APIs for
      these operations (not the native object-based interfaces).

    Changed API of packm_init_pack() to use blksz_t.
    
    Details:
    - Changed the interface of packm_init_pack() so that mult_m and mult_n
      are passed in as type blksz_t* instead of dim_t.
    - Make similar change for packv_init_pack().

    Minor changes to lower levels of scalm and setm.
    
    Details:
    - Removed diagx parameter from lower-level interfaces of scalm.
    - Modified scalm_basic_check() to expect an object with a nonunit diagonal.
    - Changed setm_unb_var1() so that having an implicit unit diagonal results
      in only the strictly lower or upper triangle of the matrix being modified.

      operation that needed updating.
    - Added Devin to CREDITS file.

    Removed some calls to setv() in test modules.
    
    Details:
    - Removed calls to setv() in test modules whose sole purpose was to
      initialize vectors to zero to ensure that nan's and inf's would not
      taint the computation. Now that beta == zero semantics have been
      updated to clear the output operand (when beta is zero), rather than
      multiply against it, these setv() calls are no longer needed.

    Properly implemented beta == 0 semantics.
    
    Details:
    - Changed name of set0 and set0_mxn macros to set0s and set0s_mxn,
      respectively.
    - Added code to the following operations that sets the output operand to
      zero if the corresponding scalar is zero (rather than performing the
      floating-point multiply, or in the case of setv, copying the value).
      This will prevent nan's and inf's from creeping into results from
      uninitialized memory.

    Fixed stale interface to packm_unb_var1().
    
    Details:
    - Removed the control tree from the interface to packm_unb_var1(), which
      I meant to do when it was un-deprecated.

    Un-deprecated packm_unb_var1.c (needed by l2 ops).
    
    Details:
    - Added bl2_packm_unb_var1() back into the mix once I realized that level-2
      operations still need this routine for packing matrices. Now, whether
      level-2 operations should be packing matrices to begin with is another
      matter. But this fixes the segmentation fault one would have gotten when
      running bl2_gemv() on a general stride matrix.

    Removed cntl tree usage from packm implementation.
    
    Details:
    - Added new fields to obj_t info field:
      - invert_diag
      - pack_order_if_upper
      - pack_order_if_lower
      These fields allow packm_init() to embed information that begins
      in the control tree into the object so that the packm implementation
      does not need to use control trees at all. This is being done to aid
      Bryan's DxT code generation.
    - Added macros that operate on above fields.
    - Changed packm_init(), packm_blk_var2(), and packm_blk_var3() according
      to above changes.
    - Made similar (but much simpler) changes to packv.
    - Deprecated packm_blk_var1(), packm_unb_var1(), and packm_densify().
      These were part of prototype implementations and are no longer needed.

Date:   Mon Feb 11 13:20:44 2013 -0600

    Added unified test suite, and many fixes.
    
    Details:
    - Added a highly configurable, unified test suite.
    
    - Removed DUPB configuration constant from bl2_kernel.h and macro-kernel
      header files. Now, instead, DUPB is computed as (NDUP != 1) within each
      macro-kernel. This fixes a bug in trmm/trsm whereby bp was indexed into
      incorrectly when DUPB was set to FALSE but the NDUP was still non-unit.
      By encoding both pieces of information into one constant in _kernel.h,
      it seems somewhat less likely others will encounter this bug in the
      future.
    - Added level-2 cache blocksizes to _kernel.h for reference configuration,
      and defined blocksizes in _cntl.c files to these default values.
    
    - Changed semantics of her2k and syr2k such that these operations no longer
      expect the B matrix to already be conjugate-transposed (or just transposed
      for syr2k). However, these semantics are preserved for the internal
      mechanics of the implementations, including the internal back-end and all
      blocked variants.
    - Inserted checks for real-valued alpha and beta for herk/her2k and herk,
      respectively.
    
    - Relaxed general object structure constraints in _basic_check() for gemv, ger.
    - Changed her front-end to NOT copy-cast to real projection; instead, this is
      replaced by selecting either the real part or both parts within the unblocked
      algorithm implementation, depending on the value of conjh.
    - Added conjh to all _check routines for her so that the code knows when to
      verify that alpha has an imaginary component equal to zero (for her, but
      not syr).
    - Changed control tree for her to forgo packing.
    
    - Added unit diagonal support to fnormm.
    - Redefined real versions of abval2s macros in terms of fabs(), fabsf().
    - Redefined complex versions of sqrt2s macros using the actual "complex square
      root" formula.
    - Created new level-0 object-based routines, suffixed with "sc" (for "scalar").
    - Defined new level-1v, -1d, and -1m versions of add and sub operations
      (two-operand add and subtract).
    - Added new scalar macros:
      - getris: acquire real and imaginary components.
      - setris: set real and imaginary components.
      - addjs: addition with conjugated x.
      - subjs: subtraction with conjugated x.
    - Defined new utility operations:
      - absumv: element-wise sum of absolute values for vector elements.
      - absumm: element-wise sum of absolute values for matrix elements.
      - mkherm: convert existing matrix to Hermitian.
      - mksymm: convert existing matrix to symmetric.
      - mktrim: convert existing matrix to triangular.
    
    - Added various error checking routines.
    - Added bl2_clock_min_diff(), which is used to more cleanly measure the
      wall clock time of a code block.
    - Added general stride support to bl2_obj_alloc_buffer().
    - Added bl2_obj_init_scalar().
    - Updated parameter mapping in bl2_param_map.c.
    - Added support for queriable version string.
    
    - Fixed a bug in the her2k macro-kernels (which currently are simply
      implemented in terms of two invocations of herk) whereby beta was being
      applied to both the first and second rank-k updates, rather than only
      the first.
    - Fixed a bug in trmm/trsm whereby transpose and right side cases were not
      properly implemented due to erroneous assumptions regarding aliasing and
      root objects.
    - Fixed a bug in the upper triangular trsm macro-kernel in which the wrong
      MR x NR block of B was being updated.
    - Fixed a bug in the inverts macro in the double real case whereby the
      value was typecast to float before inversion. This affected non-unit cases
      of dtrsm.
    - Fixed a bug in the reference kernels for gemmtrsm whereby the minus one
      constant was being applied incorrectly.
    - Fixed a bug in the overall treatment of non-unit alpha for trsm. The code
      now mimics the rank-k strategy of gemm, whereby alpah is applied during
      the first iteration of variant 3, with BLIS_ONE passed in instead for
      subsequent iterations. This also required passing alpha into the macro-
      kernels as well as the fused gemmtrsm micro-kernels.
    - Fixed a bug in trsm_u_blk_var1 whereby the gemm macro-kernel was being
      called for blocks strictly above the diagonal. While this sounds good in
      theory, this cannot be done because gemm_ker_var2 expects row panels of
      A to be packed from top to bottom, while for trsm_u, A is actually packed
      from bottom to top due to the reverse (BR->TL) nature of the algorithm.
    - Fixed a bug in packm_cxk() whereby panel packings with unit panel
      dimensions were mishandled due to incorrect arguments to the copyv kernel.
      Also changed the copyv kernel invocation to scal2v so that these edge
      cases are properly handled when scaling is requested.
    - Fixed a bug in packv_int() whereby an uninitialized object is passed in
      instead of the source object.
    - Fixed a bug whereby level-2 code could allocate memory dynamically via
      bl2_malloc() and then attempt to free it via bl2_mm_release(). Also fixed
      a potential future bug whereby a mem_t object that is actually no longer
      "allocated" from the static pool is mistaken for being allocated due to
      failure to NULLify the buffer when the block was most recently released.
    - Fixed a bug in bl2_acquire_mpart_*() whreby the uplo field was mistakenly
      toggled when the requested subpartition needed to be "reflected" due to it
      residing in an unstored region.

    Defined Frobenius norm operations.
    
    Details:
    - Added level-0 grabis macro operation to grab imaginary component of one
      variable and copy it to the real component of another variable.
    - Defined sumsqv operation, which computes the sum of the absolute squares
      of the elements of a vector. This implementation is modeled after ?lassq
      in netlib LAPACK.
    - Defined fnormv and fnormm operations, which compute the Frobenius norm on
      vectors and matrices, respectively. These operations are treated as one-
      operand operations where the output norm value is the real projection of
      the datatype of the input operand. Both operations are implemented in terms
      of sumsqv.

    Details:
    - Added function and prototype macro-generating macros for GENTFUNCR and
      GENTPROTR, which are one-operand macros with auxiliary real projection
      types.
    - Tweaked bl2_machval files to use new macros.

    Details:
    - Fixed some inconsistent usage of n_iter_max and n_iter in the two
      bl2_set_dims_incs_uplo_[12]m macros. The right thing ended up happening
      despite the bug, which is why I had not discovered it until now.

    Renamed x86,x86_64 kernels to indicate 'd' fusing.
    
    Details:
    - Renamed x86 and x86_64 kernels to contain a 'd' before the fusing shape
      to emphasize that the fusing shape is not for all datatype instances, but
      rather just for one (that of double-precision real). Other fusing shapes
      would be proportional to their precision and domain "byte footprints".
    - Corresponding changes to config/clarksville/bl2_kernel.h.

    More tweaks to _config.h, _kernel.h; smem tweaks.
    
    Details:
    - Moved kernel-related definitions form bl2_config.h to bl2_kernel.h.
    - Replaced #define of _GNU_SOURCE with #define of _POSIX_C_SOURCE. This
      accomplishes the same thing (enabling posix_memalign()) without enabling
      all of the GNU extensions we don't need.
    - Defined the size of the static memory pool in terms of MC, KC, and NC,
      as well as two new constants that determine how many MCxKC blocks and
      how many KCxNC blocks should be allocated (defined in bl2_config.h).
    - In the case of static memory pool exhaustion, replaced the generic
      bl2_abort() with a specific error code call.

    Expanded reference packm/unpackm kernel set to 16.
    
    Details:
    - Added 10xk, 12xk, 14xk, and 16xk reference kernels for packm and
      unpackm.
    - Updated bl2_[un]packm_cxk() to silently use scal2m if "out of range"
      kernel size is requested. (Thanks to Tyler for finding this bug.)
    - Updated bl2_kernel.h to contain new _KERNEL definitions, according
      to above changes, for 'reference' and 'clarksville' configurations.
