/**
 * This is a helper class that we use to load the symbols
 * from the reference library dynamically so that we get
 * the reference solution.
 * Since dynamic loading can be time consuming this class works
 * in the following manner.
 * - We have a thread local instance of this object. That means
 *   that for each executable there is a global variable called
 *   refCBLASModule.
 * - The constructor of refCBLASModule (which is called automatically)
 *   loads the library either with a call to dlopen (Linux) or with
 *   a call to LoadLibrary (Windows).
 * - Similarly the destructor unloads the library.
 * - The member function loadSymbol() is used to return the pointer
 *   to that symbol in the library, either with a call to ldsym (Linux)
 *   or with a call to GetProcAddress (Windows).
 * This means that the library is only loaded once per executable
 * due to having the global variable refCBLASModule and unloaded once
 * at the end. Multiple calls to loadSymbol are used to access the
 * corresponding API used for reference.
