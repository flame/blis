		/* Under normal circumstances, the packm kernel will copy over a
		   panel_dim x panel_len submatrix of A into P. However, the kernel
		   now handles zero-filling at edge cases, which typically consist of
		   the outer (panel_dim_max - panel_dim) rows or columns of the
		   micropanel. (Note that these rows/columns correspond to values
		   beyond the edge of matrix A.) The kernel intrinsically knows its
		   own panel_dim_max, since that corresponds to the packm kernel's
		   leading dimension. However, we *do* need to pass in panel_len_max
		   because the bottom-right edge case of trsm_lu will need all
		   elements above the extended diagonal and beyond (to the right of)
		   the bottom-right element to be initialized to zero so the trsm
		   portion of the computational kernel will operate with zeros for
		   those iterations.

		   For example, if trsm_lu is executed on an 10x10 triangular matrix,
		   and the gemmtrsm kernel uses MR = 6, the computation will begin
		   with the edge case, which is the bottom-right 4x4 upper triangular
		   matrix. Code in bli_packm_tri_cxk() will extend the diagonal as
		   identity into the remaining portion of the micropanel. But before
		   that happens, the packm kernel must have set the 0's added in
		   step (3) below.
