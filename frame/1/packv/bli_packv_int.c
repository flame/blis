	//  3. cast only: Not yet supported / not used.
	//  4. no-op: The control tree sometimes directs us to skip the
	//     pack operation entirely. Alias p to a and return.

	// NOTE: The reason we don't need to even look at the control tree in
	// this case is as follows: an object's pack status is only set to
	// BLIS_PACKED_UNSPEC for situations when the actual format used is
	// not important, as long as its packed into contiguous rows or
	// contiguous columns. A good example of this is packing for matrix

	// At this point, we can be assured that cntl is not NULL. Now we check
	// if the object has already been packed to the desired schema (as en-
	// coded in the control tree). If so, we can return, as above.
	// NOTE: In most cases, an object's pack status will be BLIS_NOT_PACKED
	// and thus packing will be called for (but in some cases packing has
	// already taken place, or does not need to take place, and so that will
	// be indicated by the pack status). Also, not all combinations of
	// current pack status and desired pack schema are valid.
