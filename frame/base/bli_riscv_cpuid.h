/* RISC-V autodetection code which works with native or cross-compilers.
   Compile with $CC -E and ignore all output lines starting with #.  On RISC-V
   it may return rv32i (base 32-bit integer RISC-V), rv32iv (rv32i plus vector
   extensions), rv64i (base 64-bit integer RISC-V), or rv64iv (rv64i plus
   vector extensions). On 128-bit integer RISC-V, it falls back to generic
   for now. For toolchains which do not yet support RISC-V feature-detection
   macros, it will fall back on generic, so the BLIS configure script may need
   the RISC-V configuration to be explicitly specified. */
