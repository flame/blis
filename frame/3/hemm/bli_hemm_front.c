	// (broadcast) element of B in the packed copy of B. Supporting
	// duplication within the logic that packs micropanels from Hermitian/
	// matrices would be ugly, and so we simply don't support it. As a
	// consequence, those subconfigurations need a way to force the Hermitian
	// matrix to be on the left (and thus the general matrix to the on the
	// right). So our solution is that in those cases, the subconfigurations
	// simply #define BLIS_DISABLE_HEMM_RIGHT.

	// prefers contiguous rows, transpose the entire operation to allow the
	// micro-kernel to access elements of C in its preferred manner.
