	// duplication within the logic that packs micropanels from symmetric
	// matrices would be ugly, and so we simply don't support it. As a
	// consequence, those subconfigurations need a way to force the symmetric
	// matrix to be on the left (and thus the general matrix to the on the
	// right). So our solution is that in those cases, the subconfigurations
	// simply #define BLIS_DISABLE_SYMM_RIGHT.
