		// Unlike variant 3 of gemm and herk, which reset the internal scalar
		// on C at the end of the first iteration so that subsequent iterations
		// do not erroneously apply beta more than once, it is important that
		// this behavior not be applied to trmm. That is because the order of
		// computation is always such that the beta that is passed into the
		// macro-kernel must be zero, since the macro-kernel only applies that
		// beta to (and thus overwrites) the row-panel of C that corresponds to
		// the current block intersecting the diagonal. It turns out that this
		// same pattern holds for trmm3 as well--except there, the beta scalar
		// is potentially non-zero, but is still applied only to the current
		// row-panel of C, and thus beta is applied to all of C exactly once.
		// Thus, for neither trmm nor trmm3 should we reset the scalar on C
		// after the first iteration.
