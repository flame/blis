// Notes:
// - The first char encodes the domain of output yr + yi.
// - The pxy precision character encodes the precision of x AND y (they
//   are assumed to be the same).
// - These macros are used to declare AND initialize variables corresponding
//   to the real and imaginary parts of (presumably) temporary variables.
//   If the domain is real, only the real part is declared and initialized.
