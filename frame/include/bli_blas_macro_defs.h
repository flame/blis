		/* The semantics of negative stride in BLAS are that the vector
		   operand be traversed in reverse order. (Another way to think
		   of this is that negative strides effectively reverse the order
		   of the vector, but without any explicit data movements.) This
		   is also how BLIS interprets negative strides. The differences
		   is that with BLAS, the caller *always* passes in the 0th (i.e.,
		   top-most or left-most) element of the vector, even when the
		   stride is negative. By contrast, in BLIS, negative strides are
		   used *relative* to the vector address as it is given. Thus, in
		   BLIS, if this backwards traversal is desired, the caller *must*
		   pass in the address to the (n-1)th (i.e., the bottom-most or
		   right-most) element along with a negative stride. */ \
