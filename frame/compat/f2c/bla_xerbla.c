/*  XERBLA  is an error handler for the LAPACK routines. */
/*  It is called by an LAPACK routine if an input parameter has an */
/*  invalid value.  A message is printed and execution stops. */

/*  Installers may consider modifying the STOP statement in order to */
/*  call system-specific exception-handling facilities. */

/*  Arguments */
/*  ========= */

/*  SRNAME  (input) CHARACTER*6 */
/*          The name of the routine which called XERBLA. */

/*  INFO    (input) INTEGER */
/*          The position of the invalid parameter in the parameter list */
/*          of the calling routine. */
