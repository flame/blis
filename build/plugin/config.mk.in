# The installation prefix, exec_prefix, libdir, includedir, and shareddir
# values from configure tell us where to install the libraries, header files,
# and public makefile fragments. We must first assign each substituted
# @anchor@ to its own variable. Why? Because the subsitutions may contain
# unevaluated variable expressions. For example, '@libdir@' may be replaced
# with '${exec_prefix}/lib'. By assigning the anchors to variables first, and
# then assigning them to their final INSTALL_* variables, we allow prefix and
# exec_prefix to be used in the definitions of exec_prefix, libdir,
# includedir, and sharedir.
