// NOTE: This file will likely only ever get compiled as part of the BLIS
// configure script, and therefore BLIS_CONFIGURETIME_CPUID is guaranteed to
// be #defined. However, we preserve the cpp conditional for consistency with
// the other three files mentioned above.
#ifdef BLIS_CONFIGURETIME_CPUID

  // NOTE: If you need to make any changes to this cpp branch, it's probably
  // the case that you also need to modify bli_arch.c, bli_cpuid.c, and
  // bli_env.c. Don't forget to update these other files as needed!

  // The BLIS_ENABLE_SYSTEM macro must be defined so that the correct cpp
  // branch in bli_system.h is processed. (This macro is normally defined in
  // bli_config.h.)

  // happen to be defined by the headers below. (This macro is normally defined
