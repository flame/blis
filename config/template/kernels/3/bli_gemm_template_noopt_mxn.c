  Template gemm micro-kernel implementation

  This function contains a template implementation for a double-precision
  complex micro-kernel, coded in C, which can serve as the starting point for
  one to write an optimized micro-kernel on an arbitrary architecture. (We
  show a template implementation for only double-precision complex because
  the templates for the other three floating-point types would be nearly
  identical.)

  This micro-kernel performs a matrix-matrix multiplication of the form:

    C11 := beta * C11 + alpha * A1 * B1

  where A1 is MR x k, B1 is k x NR, C11 is MR x NR, and alpha and beta are
  scalars.

  For more info, please refer to the BLIS website's wiki on kernels:
