  Template trsm_u micro-kernel implementation

  This function contains a template implementation for a double-precision
  real trsm micro-kernel, coded in C, which can serve as the starting point
  for one to write an optimized micro-kernel on an arbitrary architecture.
  (We show a template implementation for only double-precision real because
  the templates for the other three floating-point types would be nearly
  identical.)

  This micro-kernel performs the following operation:

    C11 := inv(A11) * B11

  where A11 is MR x MR and upper triangular, B11 is MR x NR, and C11 is
  MR x NR.

  For more info, please refer to the BLIS website's wiki on kernels:

    https://github.com/flame/blis/wiki/KernelsHowTo

  and/or contact the blis-devel mailing list.
