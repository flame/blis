  Template axpyf kernel implementation

  This function contains a template implementation for a double-precision
  complex kernel, coded in C, which can serve as the starting point for one
  to write an optimized kernel on an arbitrary architecture. (We show a
  template implementation for only double-precision complex because the
  templates for the other three floating-point types would be similar, with
  the real instantiations being noticeably simpler due to the disappearance
  of conjugation in the real domain.)

  This kernel performs the following gemv-like operation:

    y := y + alpha * conja( A ) * conjx( x )

  where A is an m x b_n matrix, x is a vector of length b_n, y is a vector
  of length m, and alpha is a scalar. The operation is performed as a series
  of fused axpyv operations, and therefore A should be column-stored.

  Parameters:

  - conja:  Compute with conjugated values of A?
  - conjx:  Compute with conjugated values of x?
  - m:      The number of rows in matrix A.
  - b_n:    The number of columns in matrix A. Must be equal to or less than
            the fusing factor.
  - alpha:  The address of a scalar.
  - a:      The address of matrix A.
  - inca:   The row stride of A. inca should be unit unless the
            implementation makes special accomodation for non-unit values.
  - lda:    The column stride of A.
  - x:      The address of vector x.
  - incx:   The vector increment of x.
  - y:      The address of vector y.
  - incy:   The vector increment of y. incy should be unit unless the
            implementation makes special accomodation for non-unit values.

  This template code calls the reference implementation if any of the
  following conditions are true:

  - Either of the strides inca or incy is non-unit.
  - The address of A, the second column of A, and y are unaligned with
    different offsets.

  If the first/second columns of A and address of y are aligned, or unaligned
  by the same offset, then optimized code can be used for the bulk of the
  computation. This template shows how the front-edge case can be handled so
  that the remaining computation is aligned. (This template guarantees
  alignment in the main loops to be BLIS_SIMD_ALIGN_SIZE.)

  Additional things to consider:

  - When optimizing, you should fully unroll the loops over b_n. This is the
    dimension across which we are fusing axpyv operations.
  - This template code chooses to call the reference implementation whenever
    b_n is less than the fusing factor, so as to avoid having to handle edge
    cases. One may choose to optimize this edge case, if desired.
  - Because conjugation disappears in the real domain, real instances of
    this kernel can safely ignore the values of any conjugation parameters,
    thereby simplifying the implementation.

  blis-devel mailing list.
