  Template dotv kernel implementation

  This function contains a template implementation for a double-precision
  complex kernel, coded in C, which can serve as the starting point for one
  to write an optimized kernel on an arbitrary architecture. (We show a
  template implementation for only double-precision complex because the
  templates for the other three floating-point types would be similar, with
  the real instantiations being noticeably simpler due to the disappearance
  of conjugation in the real domain.)

  This kernel performs an inner (dot) product operation:

    rho := conjx( x^T ) * conjy( y )

  where x and y are vectors of length n and rho is a scalar.

  Parameters:

  - conjx:  Compute with conjugated values of x?
  - conjy:  Compute with conjugated values of y?
  - n:      The number of elements in vectors x and y.
  - x:      The address of vector x.
  - incx:   The vector increment of x. incx should be unit unless the
            implementation makes special accomodation for non-unit values.
  - y:      The address of vector y.
  - incy:   The vector increment of y. incy should be unit unless the
            implementation makes special accomodation for non-unit values.
  - rho:    The address of the output scalar.

  This template code calls the reference implementation if any of the
  following conditions are true:

  - Either of the strides incx or incy is non-unit.
  - Vectors x and y are unaligned with different offsets.

  If the vectors are aligned, or unaligned by the same offset, then optimized
  code can be used for the bulk of the computation. This template shows how
  the front-edge case can be handled so that the remaining computation is
  aligned. (This template guarantees alignment to be BLIS_SIMD_ALIGN_SIZE.)

  Additional things to consider:

  - While four combinations of possible values of conjx and conjy exist, we
    implement only conjugation on x explicitly; we induce the other two cases
    by toggling the effective conjugation on x and then conjugating the dot
    product result.
  - Because conjugation disappears in the real domain, real instances of
    this kernel can safely ignore the values of any conjugation parameters,
    thereby simplifying the implementation.

  For more info, please refer to the BLIS website and/or contact the
  blis-devel mailing list.
